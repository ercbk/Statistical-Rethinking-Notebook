<p>Summaries</p>
<ul>
<li>Ch 2
<ul>
<li>Using counts
<ul>
<li>Garden of forking paths - all the potential ways we can get our sample data (sequence of marbles drawn from a bag) given a hypothesis is true (e.g.&nbsp;1 blue, 3 white marbles in a bag)</li>
<li>“Conjectures” are potential outcomes (1 blue and 3 white marbles in a bag) and each conjecture is a path in the garden of forking paths</li>
<li>With data, we count the number of ways (forking paths) the data is consistent with each conjecture (aka likelihood)</li>
<li>With new data, old counts become a prior, and updated total path counts = prior * new path counts (i.e.&nbsp;prior * likelihood)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>As components of a model
<ul>
<li>The conjecture (aka parameter value), p,&nbsp; with the most paths is our best guess at the truth. They’re converted to probabilities (i.e.&nbsp;probability of a parameter value) and now called “relative plausibilities”.</li>
<li>The likelihood is a function (e.g.&nbsp;dbinom) that gives the probability of an observation given a parameter value (conjecture)</li>
<li>Prior probabilities (or relative plausibilities) must be assigned to each unknown parameter.</li>
<li>The updated relative plausibility of a conjecture, p, is the posterior probability</li>
<li>posteriorp1 = (priorp1 * likelihoodp1) / sum(all prior*likelihood products for each possible value of parameter, p)
<ul>
<li>The denominator normalizes the updated plausability so that the sum of&nbsp; updated plausabilities for all the parameter values is 1 (necessary to formally be a proability density)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>dbinom(x, size, prob)</code> - probability density function for the binomial distribution
<ul>
<li>x = # of observations of the event (e.g.&nbsp;hitting water on the globe)</li>
<li>size = sample size (N) (number of tosses)</li>
<li>prob = parameter value (conjecture)(i.e.&nbsp;hypothesized proportion of water on the earth) (p)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ch 3 - Sampling
<ul>
<li>Sampling from the posterior
<ul>
<li>rbinom - random variable generator of the binomial distribution</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Summarizing the posterior - mean, median, MAP, HPDI</li>
<li>posterior prediction distribution
<ul>
<li>GOF Question: If we were to make predictions about the most probable p using this model, how consistent is our model with the data?
<ul>
<li>Answer: if the shape of the PPD matches the shape of the sampled posterior distribution, then the model is consistent with the data. (i.e.&nbsp;good fit)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ch 4 - Linear Models
<ul>
<li>The posterior distribution is the probability density of every combination of all the parameter values
<ul>
<li>posterior distribution: after considering every possible combination of the parameters, it’s the assigned relative plausibilities to every combination, conditional on this model and these data. (from Ch.6)
<ul>
<li>The posterior is the joint distribution of all combinations of the parameters at the same time, Pr(parameters|outcome, predictors)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Many posterior distributions are approximately gaussian/multivariate gaussian</li>
<li><span class="ribbon-highlight">Example</span>: intercept model
<ul>
<li>it’s a density of every combination of value of mean and sd</li>
</ul></li>
<li><span class="ribbon-highlight">Example</span>: Height ~ Weight
<ul>
<li>The posterior is Pr(α, β , σ | H, W)
<ul>
<li>which is proportional to Normal(W|μ,σ) ⨯ Normal(α|178,100) ⨯ LogNormal(β|0,1) ⨯ Uniform(σ|0,10)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Intro to priors</li>
<li>Model Notation
<ul>
<li><span class="ribbon-highlight">Example</span> single variable regression where height is the response and weight the predictor
<ul>
<li>hi ~ Normal(μ, σ)&nbsp; # response</li>
<li>μi = α + βxi&nbsp; # response mean (deterministic, i.e.&nbsp;no longer a parameter)</li>
<li>α ~ Normal(178, 100) # intercept</li>
<li>β ~ Normal(0, 10) # slope</li>
<li>σ ~ Uniform(0, 50) # response s.d.</li>
<li>parameters are α, β, and σ</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Centering/standardization of predictors can remove correlation between parameters
<ul>
<li>Without this transformation, parameters and their uncertainties will co-vary within the posterior distribution
<ul>
<li>e.g.&nbsp;high intercepts will often mean high slopes</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Without independent parameters
<ul>
<li>They can’t be interpreted independently</li>
<li>Effects on prediction aren’t independent</li>

</ul></li>
<li>categorical variables (not ordinals)
<ul>
<li>Using an index variable is preferred to dummy variables
<ul>

</ul></li>
<li>Ch 6 - Colliders, Multicollinearity, Post-Treatment Bias
<ul>
<li>multicollinearity
<ul>
<li>Consequences
<ul>
<li>the posterior distribution will seem to suggest that none of the collinear variables is reliably associated with the outcome, even if all of the collinear variables are in reality strongly associated with the outcome.
<ul>
<li>The posterior distributions of the parameter estimates will have very large spreads (std.devs)</li>
<li>i.e.&nbsp;parameter mean estimates shrink and their std.devs inflate as compared to the bivariate regression results.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>predictions won’t be biased but interpretation of effects will be impossible</li>
</ul></li>
<li>solutions
<ul>
<li>Think causally about what links the collinear variables and regress using that variable instead of the collinear ones</li>
<li>Use data reduction methods</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>post-treatment bias
<ul>
<li>mistaken inferences arising from including variables that are consequences of other variables
<ul>
<li>i.e.&nbsp;the values of the variable are a result after treatment has been applied</li>
<li>e.g.&nbsp;using presence of fungus as a predictor even though it’s value is determined after the anti-fungus treatment has been applied</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Consequence: it can mask or unmask treatment effects depending the causal model (DAG)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>collider bias
<ul>
<li>When you condition on a collider, it induces statistical—but not necessarily causal— associations.</li>
<li>Consequence:
<ul>
<li>The statistical correlations/associations are present in the data and may mislead us into thinking they are causal.
<ul>
<li>Although, the variables involved may be useful for predictive models as the backdoor paths do provide valid information about statistical associations within the data.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Depending on the causal model, these induced effects can be inflated</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A more complicated demonstration of Simpson’s Paradox (see My Appendix)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Applications of Backdoor Criterion
<ul>
<li>See Causal Inference note</li>
<li>Recipe
<ol type="1">
<li>List all of the paths connecting X (the potential cause of interest) and Y (the outcome).</li>
<li>Classify each path by whether it is open or closed. A path is open unless it contains a collider.</li>
<li>Classify each path by whether it is a backdoor path. A backdoor path has an arrow entering X.</li>
<li>If there are any backdoor paths that are also open, decide which variable(s) to condition on to close it.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ch 7 - Information Theory, Prediction Metrics, Model Comparison
<ul>
<li>Regularizing prior (type of skeptical prior)
<ul>
<li>Typicall priors with smaller sd values</li>
<li>Flat priors result in a posterior that encodes as much of the training sample as possible. (i.e.&nbsp;overfitting)</li>
<li>When tuned properly, reduces overfitting while still allowing the model to learn the regular features of a sample.
<ul>
<li>Too skeptical (i.e.&nbsp;sd too small) results in underfitting</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Information Entropy
<ul>
<li>The uncertainty contained in a probability distribution is the average log-probability of an event.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Kullback-Leibler Divergence (K-L Divergence)
<ul>
<li>The additional uncertainty induced by using probabilities from one distribution to describe another distribution.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Log Pointwise Predictive Density (lppd)
<ul>
<li>Sum of the log average probabilities
<ul>
<li><strong>larger is better</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The log average probability is an approximation of information entropy</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Deviance
<ul>
<li>-2*lppd
<ul>
<li><strong>smaller is better</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li>An approximation for the K-L divergence</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Predictive accuracy metrics Can’t use any information criteria prediction metrics to compare models with different likelihood functions
<ol type="1">
<li>Pareto-Smoothed Importance Sampling Cross-Validation (PSIS)
<ul>
<li>Estimates out-of-sample LOO-CV lppd
<ul>
<li>loo pkg
<ul>
<li>“elpd_loo” - <strong>larger is better</strong></li>
<li>“looic” - is just (-2 * elpd_loo) to convert it to the deviance scale, therefore <strong>smaller is better</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rethinking pkg: <strong>smaller is better</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Weights observations based on influence on the posterior</li>
<li>Uses highly influential observations to formulate a pareto distribution and sample from it(?)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Widely Applicable Information Criterion (WAIC)
<ul>
<li>Deviance with a penalty term based on the variance of the outcome variable’s observation-level log-probabilities from the posterior</li>
<li>Estimates out-of-sample deviance
<ul>
<li>loo pkg:
<ul>
<li>“elpd_waic”: <strong>larger is better</strong></li>
<li>“waic”:&nbsp; is just (-2 * elpd_waic) to convert it to deviance scale, therefore <strong>smaller is better</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rethinking pkg: <strong>smaller is better</strong></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bayes Factor
<ul>
<li>The ratio (or difference when logged) of the average likelihoods (the denominator of bayes theorem) of two models.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Model Comparison
<ul>
<li>To judge whether two models are “easy to distinguish” (i.e.&nbsp;kinda like whether their scores are statistically different), we look at the differences between the model with the best WAIC and the WAICs of the other models along with the standard error of the difference of the WAIC scores</li>
<li>Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV)
<ul>
<li>Has serious issues, I think (see Vehtari <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10296v3">paper</a> for recommendations, (haven’t read it yet))</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Outliers
<ul>
<li>Detection - High p_waic (WAIC) and k (PSIS) values can indicate outliers</li>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ch 10 - GLM Concepts
<ul>
<li>The principle of maximum entropy provides an empirically successful way to choose likelihood functions. Information entropy is essentially a measure of the number of ways a distribution can arise, according to stated assumptions. By choosing the distribution with the biggest information entropy, we thereby choose a distribution that obeys the constraints on outcome variables, without importing additional assumptions. Generalized linear models arise naturally from this approach, as extensions of the linear models in previous chapters.</li>
<li>The maximum entropy distribution is the one with the greatest information entropy (i.e.&nbsp;log number of ways per event) and is the most plausible distribution.
<ul>
<li>No guarantee that this is the best probability distribution for the real problem you are analyzing. But there is a guarantee that no other distribution more conservatively reflects your assumptions.</li>
<li>maximum entropy also provides a way to generate a more informative prior that embodies the background information, while assuming as little else as possible.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Omitted variable bias can have worse effects with GLMs</li>
<li>Gaussian
<ul>
<li>A perfectly uniform distribution would have infinite variance, in fact. So the variance constraint is actually a severe constraint, forcing the high-probability portion of the distribution to a small area around the mean.</li>
<li>The Gaussian distribution gets its shape by being as spread out as possible for a distribution with fixed variance.</li>
<li>The Gaussian distribution is the most conservative distribution for a continuous outcome variable with finite variance.
<ul>
<li>The mean µ doesn’t matter here, because entropy doesn’t depend upon location, just shape.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Binomial
<ul>
<li>Binomial distribution has the largest entropy of any distribution that satisfies these constraints:
<ul>
<li>only two unordered events (i.e.&nbsp;dichotomous)</li>
<li>constant expected value (i.e.&nbsp;exp_val = sum(prob*num_events))</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If only two un-ordered outcomes are possible and you think the process generating them is invariant in time—so that the expected value remains constant at each combination of predictor values— then the distribution that is most conservative is the binomial.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Other distributions</li>

<p>Questions</p>
<ul>
<li>Ch 2
<ul>
<li>In Ch2, there are couple times where McElreath is talking about differences between Bayesian and Frequentist approaches in the terms of the subjective choices that are made by each. For Bayesians, it’s the choice of prior, and for Frequentists, it’s the choice of “estimator.” Does anybody know exactly what he’s means when he says “estimator?” My intuition is that he’s talking about something like MLE, but I don’t see how that would be a subjective choice in the same vein as the choice of prior would be.</li>
<li>“choice of estimator” keeps being referred to — what exactly is he talking about?
<ul>
<li>Sample size and reliable inference (pg 31)
<ul>
<li>“A Bayesian golem must choose an initial plausibility, and a non-Bayesian golem must choose an estimator.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>prior, prior, pants of fire (pg 36)
<ul>
<li>non-Bayesian procedures need to make choices that Bayesian ones do not, such as choice of estimator or likelihood penalty</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ch 3
<ul>
<li>Posterior Predictive Distribution
<ul>
<li>weighted frequency average blah blah blah isn’t completely clear to me, so how is this calculation actually done
<ul>
<li>pr = prob of a param value (or conjecture) from sampled posterior density</li>
<li>W = total count for a value of W&nbsp; for all the trials for given param value</li>
<li>cn = number of conjectures</li>
<li>wn = number of possible count of W for each trial</li>
<li>weighted frequency average for W = 4 is [(prc1 *&nbsp; W4c1) + (prc2 * W4c2) + …. + (prcn * W4cn)] / cn</li>
</ul></li>
<li>these are counts unlike the posterior density
<ul>
<li>therefore maybe the shape is dependent on “size”?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Thought: likelihood is the probability of a conjecture given the data then the denominator “standardizes” that probability in terms of the other likelihoods. This standardized probability is the proportion of the updated posterior probability density that is attributable to this conjecture.
<ul>
<li>actually it would need to be the whole thing (i.e.&nbsp;the whole quantity calc’d in bayes theorem) but I think that’s what it is. And these must all be additive, or maybe not additive but the integral from p = whatever to p = whatever</li>
</ul></li>
<li>enjoyed the fig.&nbsp;looking at in reverse helped me think about the posterior density and bayes equation. The standardizing of the likelihoods for a particular parameter value is the proportion it attributes to the density.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ch 4
<ul>
<li>Thoughts
<ul>
<li>The likelihood, prior, and posterior densities are probability densities each with an area = 1. Looking at the marble tables it looks like the individual posterior probabilities sum to 1. So, the sum (we’re talking densities so probably this “sum” = integration actually) of all the products of the multiiplication of the prior and likelihood densities must not have an area = 1. Therefore, the denominator (i.e.&nbsp;sum of products) then standardizes these products so the posterior density does have an area of 1.</li>
<li>Would this make the posterior a joint density of parameter combinations (aka conjectures)?&nbsp; It does (pg 96)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>?
<ul>
<li>extracting samples from the posterior: “it uses the variance-covariance matrix and coefficients to define a multivariate Gaussian posterior to draw n samples from.”
<ul>
<li>how does this work?
<ul>
<li>bottom page 101</li>
</ul></li>
<li>can’t find the code</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ch 7
<ul>
<li>dgp
<ul>
<li><p>yi ∼ Normal(µi , 1) µi = (0.15)x1,i − (0.4)x2,i</p></li>
<li><p>The first model, with 1 free parameter to estimate, is just a linear regression with an unknown mean and fixed σ = 1. Each parameter added to the model adds a predictor variable and its beta-coefficient. Since the “true” model has non-zero coefficients for only the first two predictors, we can say that the true model has 3 parameters</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Doesn’t makes sense when he says WAIC and CV are trying to predict different things.
<ul>
<li>although their equations for lppd are slightly different. BUT they’re both lppd. So is the difference just a typo?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>His interpretation of WAIC having better accuracy of out-of-sample deviance doesn’t make sense. We have no true deviance value. I mean if its an estimate of the K-L divergence, does that mean the true deviance value is supposed to zero at 3 parameters.
<ul>
<li>“WAIC is unsurprisingly a little better at predicting out-of-sample deviance, because that is what it aims to predict. Cross-validation (CV) is a trick that estimates out-of-sample deviance as the sample size increases, but it doesn’t aim for the right target at small sample sizes. And since PSIS approximates CV, it has the same issue.”</li>
<li>“CV and PSIS have higher variance as estimators of the K-L Divergence, and so we should expect WAIC to be better in many cases.”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ch 8
<ul>
<li>pg 246 First he scales the predictor by dividing by the max, because 0 is meaningful. Then he centers it by subtracting the mean from it, because he wants to be able to define the prior more easily.
<ul>
<li>I haven’t thought much about this but what’s the interpretation here?&nbsp; Is it in sd units still even though it’s scaled by the max?
<ul>
<li>doubtful</li>
<li>Maybe Gelman’s book has something</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Instead of scaling a centered value (standardization), he centered a scaled value. So the answer is how does a centered value get interpreted?
<ul>
<li>Does the order of operations matter here?
<ul>
<li>Yes. Depends when the mean is taken. Is it taken on the scaled value or the original scale value</li>
</ul></li>
<li>for a unit increase above the mean value, the outcome variable increases by <coef> amount. The intercept is the value of the outcome when the predictor is held at its mean.
<ul>
<li>The mean value is some value between 0 and 1 where 1 is the maximum</li>
<li>Whats a unit in this case? 0.1?</li>
</ul></coef></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>8.3.2 pg 259
<ul>
<li>He sets intercept prior to have range that has 5% of the mass outside the possible range of the outcome variable. Why have a potential for values outside the range at all?</li>
<li>He says, “the goals here are to assign weakly informative priors to discourage overfitting”
<ul>
<li>How does this match up with “flat priors encourage overfitting?” Is a conservative/skeptical prior considered a weakly informative prior?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Does centering or scaling affect these prior values, I think so (because thats why we do it). Therefore may negative values are possible? 0 is no longer the base in a standardized variable. It’s the mean.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ch 9
<ul>
<li>pg 288 Talks about having more than 2000 effective samples and them being anti-correlated. Plus Stan uses an adaptive sampler. Guess this nut2, but he uses “adaptive” which makes me think of the gibb sampler. Whole paragraph is confusing to me.
<ul>
<li>Maybe correlation has something to do with the “effective” part and whatever anti-correlation is makes this number go beyond 2000 samples (the default setting that was used)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ch 10
<ul>
<li>pg 312 “This reveals that the distribution that maximizes entropy is also the distribution that minimizes the information distance from the prior, among distributions consistent with the constraints”.
<ul>
<li>Doesn’t make sense to me by looking at the equation, since the larger the log difference (ie distance) between pi and qi, larger the entropy (greater positive value).</li>
<li>Think I might be misunderstanding “the distribution that minimizes the information distance from the prior”. Maybe that’s not referring to the log distance.</li>
<li>redo log diff calcs to make sure</li>
<li>solution: The key is “consistent with constraints.” If you just choose a couple far-away pi vs pi that are close to q, then the reverse of the statement is true. But if you have a constraint, such as pis must sum to 1, then his statement is true.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ch 11
<ul>
<li>pg 352 He shows how Department could be a collider and therefore conditioning on it would open a backdoor path. But NOT conditioning on Department allows the backdoor fork path to remain open. What the solution? Find another variable that somehow disrupts the fork?</li>

<li>Differences between Bayesian and Frequentist
<ul>
<li>Parameter estimation
<ul>
<li>Bayesian Updating - Count the number of ways a parameter value can result in seeing the data sample. The parameter value that can happen the greatest number of ways is the parameter estimate. With new data, the count is updated and a new parameter estimate is chosen.
<ul>
<li>Domain knowledge (prior formulation) can be used to help the model learn</li>
<li>With posteriors, it is easy to visualize the most plausible values for the parameters and quantify any uncertainty in our estimates.</li>
<li>prior-to-posterior cycle provides a principled way to update the parameters if additional observations become available.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Frequentism - Whole model must be re-fitted</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Sample Size
<ul>
<li>Important choices for small sample sizes that effect the GOF:
<ul>
<li>Bayesian choose a prior distribution of the parameter of interest.</li>
<li>Frequentists choose an estimator</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Any rules you’ve been taught about minimum sample sizes for inference are just non-Bayesian superstitions. If you get the prior back, then the data aren’t enough.
<ul>
<li>Bayesian updating produces valid estimates at any sample size</li>
<li>Frequentism - e.g.&nbsp;around n = 30 for Guassian distribution, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bayesian inference is agnostic to any pre-specified sample size and is not really affected by how frequently you look at the data along the way (see article linked in <a href="Sample Size">Sample Size</a> &gt;&gt; Bayesian)
<ul>
<li>A bayesian power analysis to calculate a desired sample size entails using the posterior distribution probability threshold (or another criteria such as the variance of the posterior distribution or the length of the 95% credible interval)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Point Estimates
<ul>
<li>Bayesian - The parameter distribution is the estimate.
<ul>
<li>Summaries of the distribution (mean, mode, etc.) can be calculated from that distribution, but the whole distribution is what is reported and used for any subsequent calculations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Frequentist - Point estimates are calculated - usually the mean. (median would probably require a different model)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Confidence Intervals
<ul>
<li>Bayesian - the alpha used is chosen according to the use-case. 95% CIs aren’t relevant for Bayesian inference because significance testing (e.g.&nbsp;p-values) on the effect size isn’t done in Bayes. CIs are used as part of the summary of the distribution.</li>
<li>Frequentist - t-tests then p-values are calculated to determine whether 0 is contained in the interval.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For a Bayesian, there is no choice of estimator.(?) It’s always the posterior distribution.
<ul>
<li>I think this refers to the optimization procedure like least squares or negloglikelihood or maybe numerical methods of optimizing the parameters. While a Bayesian only uses the Bayes equation to solve for the posterior distribution.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Frequentists make inferences about parameters directly through a sampling distribution but for Bayesians the posterior&nbsp;distribution is not sampled but deduced logically and then samples are taken from the posterior to aid in inference.</li>
<li>Uncertainty
<ul>
<li>Frequentist: probabilities are tied to countable events and their frequencies in very large samples. Measurement uncertainty is therefore based on imaginary resamplings where the measurement values eventually would reveal a pattern. The distribution of these imaginary measurements (e.g.&nbsp;means, model estimates, etc)&nbsp; is called the <strong>sampling distribution</strong>. Frequentist uncertainty is about the randomness in a measurement.</li>
<li>Bayesian: Uncertainty is a property of having incomplete information. It’s not an inherent property of the real world.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hypothesis vs Data
<ul>
<li>Frequentist: The hypothesis or state of the world is fixed and data are variable. Meaning a hypothesis is either true or false and the data you collected is a sample. This sample is one of many different potential samples you could’ve collected from the population (distribution).</li>
<li>Bayesian: The hypothesis is variable and the data is fixed. There are many different hypotheses, and the question is which one is most plausible given this data. The data isn’t thought of as a portion of the all the data. It’s what does this data say about the plausibility of all the potential hypotheses.</li>
<li>From Post-Hoc Analysis note
<ul>
<li>Frequentist null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) determines the <em>probability of the data given a null hypothesis</em> (i.e.&nbsp;P(data|H), yielding results that are often unwieldy, phrased as the probability of rejecting the null if it is true (hence all that talk of “null worlds” earlier). In contrast, Bayesian analysis determines the <em>probability of a hypothesis given the data</em> (i.e.P(H|data)), resulting in probabilities that are directly interpretable.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Simulation of predictions
<ul>
<li>Bayesians models are always generative (i.e.&nbsp;capable of simulating predictions, aka dummy data)</li>
<li>Some Frequentist models are generative and others are not.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Many frequentist models have bayesian counterparts and vice versa
<ul>
<li>The Bayesian interpretation of a non-Bayesian procedure recasts assumptions in terms of information, and this can be very useful for understanding why a procedure works.</li>
<li>A Bayesian model can be embodied in a more efficient, but approximate, non-Bayesian procedure. Bayesian inference means approximating the posterior distribution. It does not specify how that approximation is done.</li>

<li>Pr(w)( also referred to as a Marginal Probability) averages the likelihood over the prior.

<li>1 blue marble is drawn from the bag and replaced. The bag is shaken, and a white marble is drawn and replaced. Finally, the bag is shaken, and a blue marble is drawn and replaced</li>
<li><img src="./_resources/Untitled_Note.resources/Screenshot (62).png" class="img-fluid">
<ul>
<li>each ring is a iid observation (bag shaken and a marble drawn and replaced)</li>
<li>In this <span class="ribbon-highlight">Example</span>, the “garden of forking paths” is set of all <em>potential</em> draws (consisting of 3 observations), given the conjecture of there being 1 blue and 3 white marbles in the bag</li>
</ul></li>
<li><img src="./_resources/Untitled_Note.resources/Screenshot (64).png" class="img-fluid">
<ul>
<li>If we actually do draw a marble, record the observation, replace the marble, repeat 2 more times, and the result is blue, white, blue, then these are the number of paths in each conjecture’s garden that are consistent with that outcome</li>
<li>For conjecture 1 blue, 3 white,&nbsp; 1, 3, 1 is the number of paths in each ring, respectively, that remain consistent with the sequence of recorded observations.
<ul>
<li>When multiplied together, the product equals the total consistent paths.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><img src="./_resources/Untitled_Note.resources/Screenshot (65).png" class="img-fluid">
<ul>
<li>After the bag is shaken, a new marble is drawn (new data) — it’s blue. Previous counts are now the <em>prior.</em></li>
<li>The ways this new blue marble can be drawn, given a conjecture, is used to update each prior count through multiplication.
<ul>
<li>This is equivalent to starting over and drawing another marble after the previous 3 iid observations.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The plausibility of a conjecture, p1, is the prior plausibility given p1 * new count given p1 and then that product is standardized into a probability so that it is comparable.
<ul>
<li>plausibilityp1 =&nbsp; (new_countsp1 *prior_plausibilityp1) / sum of all the (prior*new) products of the other conjectures</li>
<li>It’s the probability of the conjecture given the new data</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The plausibility of a conjecture, p, after seeing new evidence, Dnew, is proportional to the ways the conjecture, p, can produce the new evidence, Dnew, times the prior plausibility of the conjecture, p.
<ul>
<li>Equivalents:

<li><p>plausibility of <em>p</em>&nbsp;after Dnew&nbsp; <img src="./_resources/Untitled_Note.resources/unknown_filename.png" class="img-fluid"> &nbsp;ways <em>p</em> can produce Dnew x prior plausibility of <em>p</em></p></li>
<li><p><img src="./_resources/Untitled_Note.resources/unknown_filename.1.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<ul>
<li>sum of products = sum of the WAYS of each conjecture. For Conjecture 0 blues = 0 ways, Conjecture 1 blue = 3 ways (see above), Conjecture 2 blues = 8 ways, Conjecture 3 blues = 9 ways, Conjecture of 4 blues = 0. Therefore sum of products = 20.</li>
<li>if the prior plausibility of p for conjecture of 1 blue marble = 1 (and the rest of the conjectures, i.e.&nbsp;flat prior), then plausibility of conjecture 1 blue = (3*1)/20 = 0.15. The plausibility is a way to normalize the counts to be between 0 and 1.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>A conjectured proportion of blue marbles, p,&nbsp; is usually called a <strong>parameter</strong> <strong>value</strong>. It’s just a way of indexing possible explanations of the data
<ul>
<li>Here p, proportion of surface water, is the unknown parameter, but the conjecture could also be other things like sample size,&nbsp; treatment effect, group variation, etc.</li>
<li>There can also be multiple unknown parameters for the likelihood to consider.</li>
<li>Every parameter must have a corresponding prior probability assigned to it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The relative number of ways that a value p can produce the data is usually called a <strong>likelihood</strong>.
<ul>
<li>It is derived by the enumerating all the possible data sequences that could have happened and then eliminating those sequences inconsistent with the data&nbsp; (i.e.&nbsp;paths_consistent_with_data / total_paths).</li>
<li>As a model component, the likelihood is a function that gives the probability of an observation given a parameter value (conjecture)
<ul>
<li>“how likely your sample data is out of all sample data of the same length?”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><span class="ribbon-highlight"><span class="ribbon-highlight">Example</span></span> (the proportion of water to land on the earth):
<ul>
<li>W is distributed Binomially with N trials and a probability of p for W in each trial,&nbsp; <img src="./_resources/Untitled_Note.resources/unknown_filename.3.png" class="img-fluid"></li>
<li>“The count of ‘water’ observations (finger landing on water), W, is distributed binomially, with probability p of ‘water’ on each toss of a globe and N tosses in total.”</li>
<li>L(p | W, N) is another likelihood notation</li>
<li>Assumptions:
<ol type="1">
<li>Observations are independent of each other</li>
<li>The probability of observation of W (water) is the same for every observation</li>
</ol></li>
<li><code>dbinom(x, size, prob)</code>

<li>x = # of observations of water (W)</li>
<li>size = sample size (N) (number of tosses)</li>
<li>prob = parameter value (conjecture)(i.e.&nbsp;hypothesized proportion of water on the earth) (p)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The prior plausibility of any specific p is usually called the <strong>prior probability</strong>.
<ul>
<li>A distribution initial plausibilities for every value of a parameter</li>
<li>Expresses prior knowledge about a parameter and constrains estimates to reasonable ranges</li>
<li>Unless there’s already strong evidence for using a particular prior, multiple priors should be tried to see how sensitive the estimates are to the choice of a prior</li>
<li><span class="ribbon-highlight">Example</span> where the prior is a probability distribution for the parameter:
<ul>
<li>p is distributed Uniformly between 0 and 1,&nbsp; (i.e.&nbsp;each conjecture is equally likely)&nbsp; <img src="./_resources/Untitled_Note.resources/unknown_filename.4.png" class="img-fluid"></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Weakly Informative</strong> or <strong>Regularizing priors</strong>: conservative; guards against inferences of strong association
<ul>
<li>mathematically equivalent to penalized likelihood</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The new, updated relative plausibility of a specific&nbsp;<em>p</em> is called the <strong>posterior</strong> <strong>probability</strong>.</li>
<li>The set of estimates, aka relative plausibilities of different parameter values, aka posterior probabilities, conditional on the data — is known as the <strong>posterior distribution</strong> or <strong>posterior density</strong> (e.g.&nbsp;Pr(p | N, W))<strong>.</strong></li>
<li>Thoughts
<ul>
<li>The likelihood, prior, and posterior densities are probability densities each with an area = 1. Looking at the marble tables it looks like the individual posterior probabilities sum to 1. So, the sum (we’re talking densities so this “sum” = integration actually) of all the products of the multiiplication of the prior and likelihood densities must not have an area = 1. Therefore, the denominator (i.e.&nbsp;sum of products) then standardizes each of these products so the posterior density does have an area of 1.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Numerical Solvers for the posterior distribution:
<ul>
<li>Grid Approximation - compute the posterior distribution from only a portion of potential values (the grid of parameter values) for a set of unknown parameters
<ul>
<li>Doesn’t scale well as the number of parameters grows</li>
<li>Steps:
<ol type="1">
<li>Decide how many values you want to use in your grid (e.g.&nbsp;<code>seq( from = 0, to = 1, len = 1000)</code> )
<ul>
<li>number of parameter values in your grid is equal to the number of points in your posterior distribution</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Compute the prior value for each parameter value in your grid (e.g.&nbsp;<code>rep(1, 1000)</code> , uniform prior)</li>
<li>Compute the likelihood (e.g.&nbsp;using <code>dbinom(x, size, p = grid))</code>&nbsp; for each grid value</li>
<li>Multiply the likelihood times the prior which is the unstandardized posterior</li>
<li>Standardize that posterior by dividing by <code>sum(unstd_posterior)</code></li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Quadratic approximation - the posterior distribution can be represented by the Gaussian distribution quite well. The log of a Gaussian (posterior) distribution is quadratic.
<ul>
<li>Steps:
<ol type="1">
<li>Find the mode of the posterior. Uses quadratic approximation. With a uniform prior this is equivalent to MLE</li>
<li>Estimate the curvature of the posterior using another numerical method</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Needs larger sample sizes. How large is model dependent.</li>
<li>Rethinking pkg function, <code>quap( )</code>
<ul>

<li><p>Common questions to ask about the posterior distribution</p>
<ul>
<li>How much of the posterior probability lies below some parameter value?
<ul>
<li><span class="ribbon-highlight">Example</span>: Whats the posterior probability that the proportion of water on the globe is below 0.50?</li>
<li>Answer: <code>sum(samples &lt; 0.50) / total_samples</code>&nbsp; (= 1e4, see above)
<ul>
<li>“/total sample” is the procedure if there are 1 or more parameters represented in the posterior density</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>How much of the posterior probability is between two parameter values?
<ul>
<li><span class="ribbon-highlight">Example</span>: The posterior probability that&nbsp; the proportion of water is between 0.50 and 0.75?</li>
<li>Answer: <code>sum(samples &gt; 0.50 &amp; samples &lt; 0.75) / total_samples</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>** <code>sum()</code> of posterior samples gives probability for a specified parameter value **</li>
<li>** <code>quantile()</code> of posterior samples gives the parameter value for a specified probability **</li>
<li>Which parameter value marks the lower 5% of the posterior probability?
<ul>
<li>i.e.&nbsp;which proportion of water has a 5% probability?</li>
<li>Answer: <code>quantile(samples, 0.05)</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Which range of parameter values contains the middle 80% of the posterior probability?
<ul>
<li>Defined as the <strong>Percentile Interval (PI)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Frequentist CIs are normally percentile intervals, just of the sampling distribution instead of the posterior</li>
<li>Fine in practice for the most part, but bad for highly skewed posterior distributions as it’s not guaranteed to contain the most probable value.. In such cases use HPDI (see below).
<ul>
<li>If you do have an a posterior that’s highly skewed, make sure to also report the entire distribution.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Which range of proportions of water is the true value likely to be in with a 80% probability?
<ul>
<li>Answer: <code>quantile(samples, c( 0.10, 0.90))</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Which parameter value has the highest&nbsp;posterior probability?
<ul>
<li>Answer: the MAP (see below)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Credible Interval</strong>&nbsp;- General Bayesian term that is interchangeable with confidence interval. Instead an interval of probability density or mass, it’s based on an interval of the posterior probability. If choice of interval (percentile or hdpi) affects inferences being made, then also report entire posterior distribution.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Highest Posterior Density Interval (HPDI) -</strong> The narrowest interval containing the specified probability mass. Guaranteed to have the value with the highest posterior probability.<img src="./_resources/Untitled_Note.resources/image.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Left: 50% percentile interval assigns equal mass (25%) to both the left and right tail. As a result, it omits the most probable parameter value, p = 1.</p></li>
<li><p>Right: 50% HPDI finds the narrowest region with 50% of the posterior probability. Such a region always includes the most probable parameter value.</p></li>
<li><p>Disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expensive</li>
<li>Suffers from Simulation Variance (i.e.&nbsp;sensitive to number of samples).</li>
<li>Less familiar to most audiences</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>See Ch 4. uncertainty section for brms code</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Maximum a posteriori (MAP)</strong>&nbsp;- value with the highest posterior probability, aka mode of the posterior.</p></li>
<li><p>The choice of type of point estimate (MAP, median, mean) should depend on a loss function (e.g.&nbsp;L1, squared –&gt; median, L2 aka quadratic –&gt; mean, etc).</p>
<ul>
<li>If the loss is asymmetrical, e.g.&nbsp;cost rises exponentially as loss increases, then I think he’s saying that’s a good time to use MAP.</li>

<li><code>dbinom(0:2, size = 2 , prob = 0.70)</code>&nbsp; gives likelihoods for observing 0Ws, 1W, 2Ws for a trial with 2 flips given conjecture, p = 0.70</li>
<li><code>rbinom(10, size = 2, prob = 0.70)</code>&nbsp; is generating 10 data points given the conjecture (aka parameter value), p = 70%

<li>rbinom means its a binomial distribution, so only two possible outcomes in each trial</li>
<li>size = 2 means there are 2 flips per trial and means there are to be either 2 events, 1 event, or 0 events.
<ul>

</ul></li>
<li>prob = 0.70 is probability (plausibility of an event) (e.g.&nbsp;landing on Water)</li>
<li><code>table(rbinom(100000, 2, 0.70) / 100000)</code>&nbsp; is very similar to the output of dbinom above.</li>

<ul>
<li>The sampling distribution is still wide though, so the majority of experiments don’t result in the around 6 Ws.</li>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Posterior Predictive Distribution</strong>&nbsp;<strong>(PPD)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The PPD is the (simulated) distribution of outcome values we expect to see in the wild given this model and these data.</li>
<li>Equivalent to computing all the sampling distributions for each p and then averaging (by using the posterior distribution) them together (or integrating over the posterior density). This propagates the uncertainty about p of the posterior distribution into the PPD.<img src="./_resources/Untitled_Note.resources/Screenshot (77).png" class="img-fluid"></li>
<li>(Intuitive) Steps in creating the PPD for the globe <span class="ribbon-highlight">Example</span>
<ol type="1">
<li>A&nbsp; probability of hitting water (aka parameter value) is sampled from the posterior density (top pic)
<ul>
<li>More likely parameter values get sampled more often</li>
</ul></li>
<li>That sampled probability is associated with a count distribution (aka sampling distribution histogram) (middle pic) where the x-axis values are possible total counts of the event after each trial.
<ul>
<li>Each p’s sampling distribution is the distribution we’d expect to see if that p was true. (e.g.&nbsp;bell curve for p = 0.50)</li>
<li>e.g.&nbsp;<code>rbinom(10, size = 9, prob = 0.70)</code> where the sampled probability is 0.70, trials = 10, and 9 is the number of globe tosses per trial
<ul>
<li>Therefore, there’s a maximum of 9 events (i.e.&nbsp;hitting the water) possible per trial</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>This count distribution (middle pic) gets sampled, and that sampled count is tallied in the PPD (bottom pic)
<ul>
<li>e.g.&nbsp;if a 6 is sampled from the count distribution, it’s tallied in the PPD for the “6” on the x-axis</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Repeat (e.g.&nbsp;1e4 times)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Computing a PPD:
<ul>
<li><code>rbinom(number of trials, size = number of flips per trial, prob = samples from posterior density)</code>&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
<li>these are counts unlike the posterior density
<ul>
<li>therefore maybe the shape is dependent on “size”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>the posterior distribution is used as weights to calculate a weighted, average frequency of W observations for each trial.</li>
<li><span class="ribbon-highlight"><span class="ribbon-highlight">Example</span></span>: <code>rbinom(10000, 9, samples)</code>
<ul>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>GOF Question: If we were to make predictions about the most probable p using this model, how consistent is our model with the data?
<ul>
<li>Answer: if the shape of the PPD matches the shape of the sampled posterior distribution, then the model is consistent with the data. (i.e.&nbsp;good fit)</li>

<ul>
<li>Gaussian Distribution
<ul>
<li>Good toy <span class="ribbon-highlight">Example</span> that explains the shape of a Normal distribution
<ul>
<li>1000 people stand at the 50 yd line and flip a coin 16 times (doesn’t seem like a lot). Tails move one step left, heads move one step right. The shape of the people after the 16 flips will be a bell curve. If you picture people zigging left and right after flips, there are more possible sequences of flips that end with the person back where they started at the 50 yd line than say, for <span class="ribbon-highlight">Example</span>, at the 30 yd line (either goal). Therefore, ending up at the 50 yd line is most probable.
<ul>
<li>Reminds me of how there is only one way for your ear bud wires not to be tangled and many, many more ways for them to be tangled.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Additive effects make convergence to a Gaussian inevitable - Each flip can be thought of as a fluctuation from the average of the distribution with large positive fluctuations cancelling out large negative fluctuations. The more samples taken (flips), the more opportunities for fluctuations of varying sizes and sign to be paired with a fluctuation of equal size and opposite sign , resulting in a cancellation and a final sum of zero. Therefore, normality emerges as sample sizes get larger. The speed at which the sampling distribution converges to normality depends on the underlying data generating distribution.</li>
<li>Small multiplicative effects converge to a Gaussian - if the effect of interaction is a small percent (e.g.&nbsp;between 0 and 10% increase/decrease) then the resulting product of fluctuations converges to a Gaussian distribution as well. Small multiplicative effects can be well approximated additively.</li>
<li>The log of large multiplicative effects converge to a Gaussian - if the effect of interactions is a large percent (e.g.&nbsp;10-50% increase/decrease), then the product of the fluctuations are Gaussian on the log-scale (Log-Normal).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>See General Notes -&gt; Notation:&nbsp; for the notation and syntax used in model specification</li>
<li>It’s a good idea to plot your priors to get a sense of the assumptions in your model.
<ul>
<li><span class="ribbon-highlight"><span class="ribbon-highlight">Example</span></span>: <code>curve(dunif( x, 0, 50), from = -10,&nbsp; to = 60)</code>&nbsp; for σ ~ Uniform( 0, 50 ) constrains the σ to have a positive probability from 0 to 50 cm for a height outcome variable</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Prior Predictive Distribution
<ul>
<li>Priors can be previous posterior distributions, so they can be sampled in order to see the <em>expected distribution</em>, averaged over the priors, which is a distribution of relative plausibilities before seeing the data.</li>
<li><span class="ribbon-highlight">Example</span>: height ~ 1<img src="./_resources/Untitled_Note.resources/unnamed-chunk-27-1.png" class="img-fluid"></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<pre><code>sample_mu &lt;- rnorm(1e4, 178, 20) # where mean = 178 and sigma = 20
sample_sigma &lt;- runif(1e4, 0, 50) # bounded from 0 to 50
prior_predictive_distribution &lt;- rnorm(1e4, sample_mu, sample_sigma) # averaging over the priors, PPD
dens(prior_predictive_distribution) # relative plausibilities before seeing data</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><p>What our parameter priors (mean, sd) say that we expect the height distribution to look like in the wild.</p></li>
<li><p>Sampling means and std devs from posterior</p>
<ul>
<li>regardless of sample size, a gaussian likelihood * a gaussian prior will always produce a gaussian posterior distribution for the mean</li>
<li>the std.dev posterior will have a longer right tail. Smaller sample sizes = longer tail
<ul>
<li>variances are always positive. Therefore if the estimate of the variance is near zero, There isn’t much uncertainty about how much smaller it can be because its bounded by zero, but there is no bound on the right, so the uncertainty is larger.</li>
<li>**brms handles these skews fine ** because it’s posterior sampling function samples from Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) chains and not the multivariate Gaussian distribution. See Ch.8. Also Ch.9 in the brms version for modeling σ using distributional models in case of heterogeneous variances.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Similar grid approx. code to top of Ch.3. Instead of one parameter, p, it’s the mean and standard deviation.
<ul>
<li>Each value (a row number) that’s sampled represents one combination of potential values of the mean and standard deviation and is selected based on the posterior probability density.</li>
<li>This posterior density is the joint posterior density of the mean and standard deviation</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<pre><code># sample posterior probability but output the row indices and not the values
sample_rows &lt;- sample(1:nrow(posterior), size = 1e4, replace = TRUE, prob = posterior$prob)
# use sampled row indices to sample the grid values for mu and sigma

<ul>
<li>Only things to pay attention to at this point are the family, formula, and prior arguments, Think the rest of this gets covered in Ch.8.
<ul>
<li>flat priors can require a large value in the warm-up arg because of it’s weakness</li>
</ul></li>
<li>summary shows the estimates(means) of mu (intercept) and standard deviation (sigma), standard errors, CIs (percentile) along with the model specifications
<ul>
<li>These values are the Gaussian&nbsp; estimates of each parameter’s “<em>marginal</em>” distribution<img src="./_resources/Untitled_Note.resources/unnamed-chunk-47-1.png" class="img-fluid">
<ul>
<li>The marginal distribution of sigma is the distribution of the residuals</li>
<li>The marginal distribution for mu means the plausibility of each value of mu, after averaging over the plausibilities of each value of sigma.
<ul>
<li>The “averaging over” effect can be seen in the marginal distribution of sigma if you change the the prior for mu to normal(178, 0.1). The posterior estimate for mu will hardly move off the prior, but the estimate for sigma will move quite a bit from before, since the plausibilities for each value of mu changed.&nbsp;<img src="./_resources/Untitled_Note.resources/unnamed-chunk-51-1.png" class="img-fluid">
<ul>
<li>So the posterior density for sigma gets more squatted and widens with that narrow mu prior. The right tail lengthens as well.</li>
<li>I think this is an <span class="ribbon-highlight">Example</span> of how the marginal distribution of sigma is affected by mu since it has been averaged over the values of mu.</li>

<ul>
<li>Equivalent to saying you’ve observed 100 heights (1/0.01) that had a mean = 178 cm, sd = 0.01. Considered to be a pretty strong prior.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><img src="./_resources/Untitled_Note.resources/unknown_filename.16.png" class="img-fluid">
<ul>
<li>Extremely weak prior</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Model
<ul>
<li><span class="ribbon-highlight"><span class="ribbon-highlight">Example</span></span> single variable regression where height is the outcome and weight the predictor
<ul>
<li>hi ~ Normal(μ, σ)</li>
<li>μi = α + βxi</li>
<li>α ~ Normal(178, 100)</li>
<li>β ~ Normal(0, 10)</li>
<li>σ ~ Uniform(0, 50)
<ul>
<li>hi is the likelihood and ui is the linear model (now deterministic, not a parameter). The rest of the definitions are for priors.</li>
<li>A Gaussian prior for β with mu = 0 is considered conservative because it will drag the probability mass towards zero, and a β parameter at 0 is equivalent to saying, as a prior, that no relation exists between the predictor and outcome
<ul>
<li>In this case, the sigma for this prior is 10, so while it’s conservative, it’s also weak, and therefore it’s pull on β towards zero will be small. The smaller sigma is, the greater the pull of the prior.
<ul>
<li>This <em>pull</em> towards 0 is also called <strong>shrinkage</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Starting values</strong> don’t effect the posterior while priors do.&nbsp; (Also see Ch 9 &gt;&gt; Set-up Values)
<ul>
<li>inits&nbsp;argument is for starting values in brms
<ul>
<li>Either “random” or “0”. If inits is “random” (the default), Stan will randomly generate initial values for parameters.
<ul>
<li>If “0”,&nbsp; then all parameters are initialized to be zero.</li>
<li>“random” randomly selects the starting points from a uniform distribution ranging from -2 to 2</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This option is sometimes useful for certain families, as it happens that default (“random”) inits cause samples to be essentially constant.</li>
<li>When everything goes well, the MCMC chains will all have traversed from their starting values to sampling probabilistically from the posterior distribution once they have emerged from the warmup phase. Sometimes the chains get stuck around their starting values and continue to linger there, even after you have terminated the warmup period. When this happens, you’ll end up with samples that are still tainted by their starting values and are not yet representative of the posterior distribution.
<ul>
<li>setting inits = “0” is worth a try, if chains do not behave well.</li>
<li>Alternatively, inits can be a list of lists containing the initial values, or a function (or function name) generating initial values. The latter options are mainly implemented for internal testing but are available to users if necessary. If specifying initial values using a list or a function then currently the parameter names must correspond to the names used in the generated Stan code (not the names used in R).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>See this <a href="https://twitter.com/SolomonKurz/status/1527666198493667328">thread</a> which uses a custom function to create starting values for a parameter</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>In many cases a weak prior for the intercept is appropriate as it is often uninterpretable. Meaning it should have a wide range given that we can’t intelligibly estimate what range of values it might fall in-between.
<ul>
<li>e.g.&nbsp;if the model estimate for the intercept in the height ~ weight model was 113.9. This would mean that the average height for a person with zero weight is 113.9 cm which is nonsense.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Centering predictors makes the intercept interpretable. The interpretation becomes “when the predictors are at their average value, the expected value of the outcome is the value of the intercept.”
<ul>
<li>β and σ estimates aren’t affected by the transformation</li>

</ul></li>
<li>w is the parameter estimate (negative or positive) used to adjust the influence of the basis function on µ

<li>The multi-level method is used in the code block, but a single level method is possible. SEs are large in the single-level and about half the point estimates differ in sign from the multi-level.</li>
<li>Most if not all of the point estimates from the multi-level are covered by the CIs of the single-level, so I don’t think either model is “wrong” based on the estimates.</li>
<li>I’m more comfortable with the single-level method, but I’d probably choose the multi-level method based on the SEs.</li>

<li>Useful because:
<ul>
<li>Statistical “control” for confounds. A <strong>confound</strong> is something that misleads us about a causal influence. They can hide real important variables just as easily as they can produce false ones.
<ul>
<li>From section 6.4, confounding is “any context in which the association between an outcome Y and a predictor of interest X is not the same as it would be, if we had experimentally determined the values of X”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Multiple causation. A phenomenon may arise from multiple causes and estimating each with the same data is useful.</li>
<li>Stratification (the intercept is dependent on the value of the predictor)
<ul>
<li>binary or categorical - adding the adjustment variable to the model formula subsets the data and allows the model to estimate a different association for each category</li>
<li>continuous - adding the adjustment variable to model formula allows the model to estimate a different association for each value of the continuous predictor</li>
<li>Interactions - The importance of one variable may depend upon another. Effective inference about one variable will often depend upon consideration of others.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>main effects</em> are additive combinations of variables</li>
<li>Multivariate notation with Divorce Rate as the outcome and state median age <em>at</em> marriage and state marriage rate as predictors
<ul>
<li>DivorceRatei ~ Normal(μi, σ)</li>
<li>μi = α + β1MedianAgeMarriage_si + β2MarriageRate_si</li>

<li>3 types of inferential plots
<ul>
<li>Predictor Residual plots - Shows outcome vs residual predictor values
<ul>
<li>It’s a clever multi-variable version of the typical observed response vs observed predictor scatter plot plus fitted regression line.
<ul>
<li>Shows the linear relationship between the outcome and a predictor after adjusting for the other the predictors.</li>
<li>The fact that residuals are either positive or negative does add a little something different to the interpretation</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A predictor variable residual is the average prediction error when we use all of the other predictor variables to model a predictor of interest.
<ul>
<li>i.e.&nbsp;the x1 predictor residual is the residual of this regression -&nbsp; x1 ~ α + βx2 + βx3 + …
<ul>
<li>The regression removes the variation that can be attributed to the other predictor variables</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Calculating the predictor residuals assumes the relationships between the predictors are additive</li>
<li>Interpretation of the residual: When a residual is positive , that means the predictor of interest was in excess of what we’d expect, given the value of the other predictors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The slope of the regression line in this plot will be the coefficient estimate in the multi-variable regression.
<ul>
<li>Most charts for regression coefficients are just error bar plots (like above) or tables. This seems much better.
<ul>
<li>You get the distribution of the residuals (shape, spread, etc.), a visual of the slope and it’s CI, an interpretation of how the slope relates values of the predictor and the response, and partial correlation.</li>
<li>residual patterns might indicate a nonlinear transformation should be used</li>
<li>perhaps coloring by category levels might produce a pattern that indicates an interaction should be used</li>
<li>I think the spread of residuals and the linearity of the shape of this plot gives an idea of the partial correlation with the response. The tighter the spread, the larger the partial correlation</li>

<li>Interpretation of marriage rate residuals as the predictor (left): States with a <em>higher</em> <em>than expected</em> marriage rate (pos x values) have almost the same divorce rates on average as those states with <em>lower</em> <em>than expected</em> (neg x values) marriage rates (i.e.&nbsp;regression line is flat)</li>
<li>Interpretation of age at marriage residuals as the predictor (right):&nbsp; States with an <em>older</em> <em>than expected</em>&nbsp; (pos x values) median age at marriage have a much lower divorce rate on average than states with a <em>younger</em> <em>than expected</em> (neg x values) median age of marriage.</li>

<li>Shows how predictions change as you change only one predictor at a time.</li>
<li>2-stage process (See <span class="ribbon-highlight">Example</span>): Input each value of the predictor of interest into an assumed causal model to get the values of the other predictors. Then, fit the multi-regression model to get the predictions.
<ul>
<li>1st Stage: Association of predictor variable of interest is regressed out of each predictor variable and predictions are calculated from these models.</li>
<li>2nd Stage:&nbsp; The final regression model uses these predicted values as inputs for all the predictors <em>except</em> the predictor of interest</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Similar to a partial dependence plot, except for the causal model being used to calculate values of the other predictors.
<ul>
<li>pdp keeps the value of the predictor of interest constant and fits multiple models for each combination of the values of the other predictors, then takes the average of the predictions. This average is estimated response value that corresponds to predictor of interest value in the plot.</li>
<li>Both probably end up in a very similar place but the counterfactual plots sounds much less computationally intensive.</li>

<li>Masking
<ul>
<li>A special case where you have two (or more) predictors that when each is fit in a bivariable regression with the outcome, no (or only a very small effect) can be estimated. Then, when fitting all the predictors in a multivariate regression with the outcome, a measurable/increased effect is estimated.</li>
<li>This is a special combination of both predictors being mildly, positively correlated with each other while each are oppositely correlated with the outcome.</li>
<li>Situation with an outcome variable and two predictors
<ul>
<li>correlation structure
<ul>
<li>pred_var1 and pred_var1 are positively correlated</li>
<li>pred_var1 is <em>negatively</em> correlated with the outcome</li>
<li>pred_var2 is <em>positively</em> correlated with the outcome</li>
</ul></li>
<li>multi-variable regression result
<ul>
<li>pred_var1’s negative estimated effect on the outcome will increase as compared to its estimated effect in a bivariable regression</li>
<li>pred_var2’s positive estimated effect on the outcome will increase as compared to its estimated effect in a bivariable regression</li>
</ul></li>
<li><span class="ribbon-highlight"><span class="ribbon-highlight">Example</span></span>
<ul>
<li>K (outcome) = mother’s milk kilocalories</li>
<li>M (pred_var1) = log(Body Mass)</li>
<li>N (pred_var2) = Neocortex percent</li>
<li>DAGs that are consistent with the data associations<img src="./_resources/Untitled_Note.resources/Screenshot (111).png" class="img-fluid"> where U is an unknown variable. Unobserved variables are circled.
<ul>
<li>All three DAGs have no conditional independencies (e.g.&nbsp;a single path DAG) and therefore no testable implications
<ul>
<li>A set of DAGs, each with the same conditional independencies known as a <em>Markov Equivalence</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Data cannot eliminate any of these DAGS. Domain knowledge must be used to reduce the number of Markov Equivalent DAGs.</li>
<li>Also see <a href="Causal Inference">Causal Inference</a> &gt;&gt; Statistical Rethinking &gt;&gt; Testable Implications</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>How does including both variables in the regression reveal the effect?
<ul>
<li>The model uses the opposite relationship of predictors with the outcome to find the most i_nteresting_ (think variation) cases in order to measure the effects of each predictor.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The closer the size of the correlation between the two pred_vars gets to 1, the larger the change in the estimated effect. Very close to 1 means both have very similar information and using both is redundant (see multicollinearity below)
<ul>
<li>Closer to zero = smaller increase in effect (i.e.&nbsp;masking diminishes)(independent variables)
<ul>
<li>Less correlation between variables –&gt; less masking</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>For Discussion on masking and multicollinearity see My Appendix</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Categorical
<ul>
<li>Misc
<ul>
<li>Why we don’t split data by a categorical and run separate regressions? (from 8.1 pg 245)
<ol type="1">
<li>You make 2 worse estimations of the variance (sigma) by using smaller amounts of data instead of one estimate using all the data</li>
<li>If you want parameter estimates of the splitting variable and uncertainty of that estimate, it needs to be in the model</li>
<li>Models must use the same data, if you use information criteria based metrics for comparison</li>
<li>Multi-level models can use information across categories</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Including a categorical (no interaction) allows the model to predict different means for each category/level.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Binary
<ul>
<li>❌ <span class="ribbon-highlight">Example</span> with the categorical variable as an indicator variable
<ul>
<li>hi ∼ Normal(µi, σ) µi = α + βmmi α ∼ Normal(178, 20) βm ∼ Normal(0, 10) σ ∼ Uniform(0, 50)
<ul>
<li>h = height, m = sexmale</li>
<li>βm represents the expected difference between males and females in height</li>
<li>α is the average female height</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The problem with this method is that male has two parameters, α and βm, associated with it and therefore twice the uncertainty as compared to female which only has α.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>✔ <span class="ribbon-highlight">Example</span> with the categorical variable as an index variable
<ul>
<li>hi ∼ Normal(µi , σ) µi = αsex[i] αj ∼ Normal(178, 20) , for j = 1 &amp; 2 σ ∼ Uniform(0, 50)
<ul>
<li>results in two α parameters, one for each sex, and both can use the same prior. Therefore, both sexes have the same uncertainty.&nbsp;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Always been taught that this approach inherently orders the categories, e.g.&nbsp;since 2 &gt; 1, but I guess this is kosher is bayesian models</li>
<li>Note: there is no intercept used in these models with only categorical predictors</li>

<li>Comparing the parameter of interest’s posterior density to its prior will tell you how much information your data is providing
<ul>
<li>If the posterior density is similar to the prior, then the data is not providing much information.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>3 of the potential problems are discussed
<ul>
<li>Multicollinearity
<ul>
<li>A *very strong* relationship between 2 or more of the predictors</li>
<li>Consequence of it is that the posterior distribution will seem to suggest that none of the variables is reliably associated with the outcome, even if all of the variables are in reality strongly associated with the outcome.
<ul>
<li>The posterior distributions of the parameter estimates will have very large spreads (std.devs)</li>
<li>i.e.&nbsp;parameter mean estimates shrink and their std.devs inflate as compared to the bivariate regression results.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><img src="./_resources/Untitled_Note.resources/unknown_filename.17.png" class="img-fluid">
<ul>
<li>When two predictors are highly correlated (&gt;0.90), they contain almost the same information. So, you’re essentially using the same variable and therefore there are infinite combinations of values of β1 and β2 with each equally plausible that result in the same prediction for y. So, the uncertainty of the estimates for those parameters is infinite.
<ul>
<li>results in&nbsp; very large standard deviations</li>
<li>potentially breaks the model function and you’ll get a “non-identifiable” error
<ul>
<li><em>Non-identifiability</em>: the structure of the data and model do not make it possible to estimate the parameter’s value. Multicollinearity is a type of non-identifiability problem.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The predictions estimated by the model will be fine, but there can be no inference drawn from the parameter estimates.</li>
<li>In the case of strongly, negatively correlated predictors that are oppositely correlated with the outcome, the effect estimates for each predictor shrink to/near zero and therefore each may be a good predictor, but including both is redundant. (sect 5.3.2 1st ed; 6.1.2 2nd ed).
<ul>
<li>“And what matters isn’t just the correlation between a pair of variables. Rather, what matters is the correlation that remains after accounting for any other predictors.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>** Also see Ch 11 &gt;&gt; (last one) <span class="ribbon-highlight">Example</span>: “aggregated binomial” regression (<strong>unbalanced</strong> number of trials) &gt;&gt; over-parameterization</li>
<li>Solutions
<ul>
<li>Identifying and <em>automatically</em> dropping highly correlated predictors is a mistake. Pairwise correlations are not the problem. It is the conditional associations—not correlations—that matter. And even then, the right thing to do will depend upon what is causing the collinearity. The associations within the data alone are not enough to decide what to do.

<li>The fungus variable (f-intercept)(aka post treatment effect) completely masks the effect of the treatment (t-intercept), effectively zeroing it out. <img src="./_resources/Untitled_Note.resources/Screenshot (115).png" class="img-fluid">
<ul>
<li>When we include F, the post-treatment effect, in the model, we end up blocking the path from the treatment to the outcome. This is the DAG way of saying that learning the treatment tells us nothing about the outcome, once we know the fungus status. Conditioning on F induces d-separation.</li>
<li><strong>d-separation</strong> (directional separation): some variables on a directed graph are independent of others. There is no path connecting them.
<ul>
<li>e.g.&nbsp;In this case, H1 is d-separated from T, but only when we condition on F, H1 _||_ T|F (conditional independency). Also, F _||_ H0 and H0 _||_ T (collider, H1, no conditioned on)</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Collider Bias
<ul>
<li>When you condition on a collider, it induces statistical—but not necessarily causal— associations among its causes.
<ul>
<li>Although, the variables involved may be useful for predictive models as the backdoor paths do provide valid information about statistical associations within the data</li>

<ul>
<li>Adjusting for S (collider) induces an association between T and N.</li>
<li>Once you learn that a grant proposal has been selected (S), then learning its trustworthiness (T) (i.e.&nbsp;the rigorousness of the experimental design) also provides information about its newsworthiness (N) (i.e.&nbsp;importance of the experiment to the public).
<ul>
<li>We only see the selected grants not the failed grant proposals (i.e.&nbsp;selection bias, adjusting by S), so while there is no association between T and N in the population, if we look at the subset of selected grants (S), we will see an association.</li>

<li>Simpson’s Paradox is a statistical phenomenon where adding a conditioning variable(s) changes the effect and interpretation of the variable of interest.

<li>** The data alone can never tell us when a DAG is right. But the data can tell us when a DAG is wrong.**
<ul>
<li>e.g.&nbsp;testing conditional independencies of a DAG with the data can invalidate a DAG.</li>
<li>Me: Experiment and theory are needed to also prove a DAG is right.
<ul>
<li>I think that’s right — that “proving a DAG right” and making a valid causal inference are two different things
<ul>
<li>from 6.3, “If you don’t have a causal model, you can’t make inferences from a multiple regression. And the regression itself does not provide the evidence you need to justify a causal model. Instead, you need some science”</li>
<li>From summary: Although the DAG and data modeling “allow you to make valid casual inferences.”</li>
<li>Proving the causal model right is the endgame, but making a valid causal inference is just saying, “The evidence from the data doesn’t dispute the causal model (i.e.&nbsp;DAG) that X causes Y.”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Many dynamical systems cannot be usefully represented by DAGs, because they have complex behavior that is sensitive to initial conditions.
<ul>
<li>These models can still be analyzed and have causal interventions designed from them.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Multivariable regression models describe conditional associations, not causal influences. Therefore additional information, from outside the model, is needed to make sense of it (e.g.&nbsp;the DAG/causal model).</li>

<li>Information Theory seeks a measure of uncertainty that satisfies three criteria:&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>The measure should be continuous</li>
<li>It should increase as the number of possible events increases</li>
<li>It should be additive</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Information Entropy - The uncertainty contained in a probability distribution is the average log-probability of an event.<img src="./_resources/Untitled_Note.resources/ql_e2dc4a4f7be6a0899ef268673c1b3140_l3.png" class="img-fluid">
<ul>
<li>where there are n different possible events and each event i has probability pi</li>
<li>The smaller the probability of an event, pi, the larger the uncertainty, H, is.</li>
<li>A precise definition of “uncertainty” with which we can provide a baseline measure of how hard something is to predict, as well as how much improvement is possible.</li>
<li><span class="ribbon-highlight">Example</span> (information entropy for the weather):
<ul>
<li><p>If true probabilities of rain and shine are p1 = 0.3 and p2 = 0.7, respectively H(p) = − (p1 log(p1) + p2 log(p2)) ≈ 0.6</p></li>
<li><p>If true probabilities of rain and shine are p1 = 0.01 and p2 = 0.99, respectively H(p) = − (p1 log(p1) + p2 log(p2)) ≈ 0.06</p>

<ul>
<li>The additional uncertainty induced by using probabilities from one distribution to describe another distribution.</li>
<li>The average difference in log probability between the target (p) and model (q) (i.e.&nbsp;difference of two entropies in “units of entropy”)
<ul>
<li>p is the truth and q is an approximation</li>
<li>We don’t actually know the “truth” of course, so this whole thing is theoretical
<ul>
<li>Information criteria estimate this theoretical value to compare models for predictive accuracy.</li>
<li>The “truth”, p,&nbsp; gets sorta gets subtracted out when we compare two models (see book for details)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When p = q, we know the actual probabilities of the events</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The divergence helps us contrast different approximations (i.e.&nbsp;models) of p as a distance measure
<ul>
<li>The smaller the divergence, DKL, the better the model.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>DKL can also be defined using <em>cross-entropy:</em> DKL(p, q) = H(p, q) − H(p)
<ul>
<li>where cross-entropy, H(p, q) = − Σ pi log(qi)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>DKL(p,q) != DKL(q, p)</li>
<li>side note (used in chapter 10): If we use a distribution with high entropy to approximate an unknown true distribution of events, we will reduce the distance to the truth and therefore the error.</li>

<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Pareto-Smoothed Importance Sampling Cross-Validation (PSIS)</strong>
<ul>
<li>An out-of-sample,&nbsp; LOO CV&nbsp; lppd is calculated by using “importance” weighting.
<ul>
<li><code>brms::loo_compare</code> or <code>brms::loo</code> - wrappers for <code>loo::loo</code> (<a href="https://mc-stan.org/loo/reference/loo.html">docs</a>)
<ul>
<li>“elpd_loo” - <strong>larger is better</strong></li>
<li>“looic” - is just (-2 * elpd_loo) to convert it to the deviance scale, therefore <strong>smaller is better</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rethinking pkg: <strong>smaller is better</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The posterior is sampled and “importance” weights are calculated for each observation based on how much the posterior distribution “would change” if that observation is removed.
<ul>
<li>An observation that is expected (i.e.&nbsp;more likely) is less important and given a smaller weight.
<ul>
<li>An “expected” observation is one that has a high probability in the posterior (i.e.&nbsp;towards the center of the mass). It’s less important, because if it’s removed, there are plenty of other points with similar information. Therefore, the posterior density wouldn’t change that much.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Pareto distribution is used to make the weights calculation more reliable.
<ul>
<li>Observations with very large weights can dominate the calculation of the lppd estimate</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The largest weights are used to estimate a Pareto distribution. The distribution is used to “smooth” the large weights (somehow).
<ul>
<li>The shape parameter of the distribution, k, is estimated. When k &gt; 0.5, then the distribution has infinite variance. PSIS weights perform well as long as k &lt; 0.7. Large k values can be used to identify influential observations (i.e.&nbsp;rare observations/potential outliers).
<ul>
<li>For brms, warnings for high k values will show when using <code>add_criterion(mod, "loo")</code>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Outliers make it tough to estimate out-of-sample accuracy, since rare values are unlikely to be in the new sample. (i.e.&nbsp;overfitting risk)</li>
<li>Also, warnings about high k values can occur when the sample size is small
<ul>
<li>When looking at the posterior, keep in mind that “influential” data values might be significantly affecting the posterior distribution.</li>

<li>Information Criteria
<ul>
<li>Information criteria construct <em>a theoretical estimate of the relative out-of-sample K-L Divergence</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)</strong> AIC <strong>=</strong> Dtrain + 2p <strong>=</strong> −2lppd + 2p
<ul>
<li>p = number of free parameters in the posterior distribution</li>
<li>The “2” is just for scaling</li>
<li>So, just the deviance + the number of (free) parameters
<ul>
<li>Says the dimensionality (i.e.&nbsp;complexness) a model is directly proportional to it’s tendency to overfit.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Conditions for reliability
<ol type="1">
<li>The priors are flat or overwhelmed by the likelihood (?).</li>
<li>The posterior distribution is approximately multivariate Gaussian.</li>
<li>The sample size, N, is much greater than the number of parameters, k.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>** Flat priors are rarely the best priors, so AIC not really useful. But it’s the inspiration for other metrics. **</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Widely Applicable Information Criterion (WAIC)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Performance is very similar to PSIS but doesn’t have as many diagnostic features as PSIS.<img src="./_resources/Untitled_Note.resources/Screenshot (152).png" class="img-fluid">
<ul>
<li>y is the observations, Θ is the posterior distribution</li>
<li>It’s deviance + a penalty that’s proportional to the variance of posterior density
<ul>
<li>loo pkg:
<ul>
<li>“elpd_waic”: <strong>larger is better</strong></li>
<li>“waic”:&nbsp; is just (-2 * elpd_waic) to convert it to deviance scale, therefore <strong>smaller is better</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rethinking pkg: <strong>smaller is better</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Effective number of parameters, pwaic</strong> (aka the penalty term or overfitting penalty)
<ul>
<li>Says compute the variance in log-probabilities for each observation i, and then sum up these variances to get the total penalty.</li>
<li>Called such because in ordinary linear regressions the sum of all penalty terms from all points tends to be equal to the number of free parameters in the model
<ul>
<li>When the sum is larger than the number of free parameters, it can indicate an outlier is present which will increase the overfitting risk.</li>

<li>Not always possible to compute the average likelihood</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Model Comparison
<ul>
<li>For inference, scientific considerations already select the relevant model. Instead comparison is about measuring the impact of model differences while accounting for overfitting risk.</li>
<li>** Can’t use any information criteria prediction metrics to compare models with different likelihood functions ** (Ch 10)</li>
<li>** Don’t compare models with different numbers of observations ** (Ch 11)
<ul>
<li>e.g.&nbsp;1/0 logistic regression model vs aggregated logistic regression model</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV)
<ul>
<li>Has serious issues, I think (see Vehtari <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10296v3">paper</a> for recommendations, (haven’t read it yet))</li>
</ul></li>
<li>To judge whether two models are “easy to distinguish” (i.e.&nbsp;kinda like whether their scores are statistically different), we look at the differences between the model with the best WAIC and the WAICs of the models (waic_diff) along with the standard error of the difference of the WAIC scores (waic_se_diff).
<ul>
<li>Or the substantively same score, elpd_waic</li>
<li><code>loo_compare</code> lists the best model first, then the next best model, etc. according to the criterion arg</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>elpd waic</strong> = lppd - p_waic. So it’s just WAIC without the conventional multiplication by -2.
<ul>
<li><strong>higher is better now though</strong></li>
<li>Instead of waic se differences, elpd waic se differences are used, which is the substantively the same thing
<ul>
<li>loo package authors aren’t fans of the frequentist -2* convention.
<ul>
<li>“These standard errors, for all their flaws, should give a better sense of uncertainty than what is obtained using the current standard approach of comparing differences of deviances to a Chi-squared distribution, a practice derived for Gaussian linear models or asymptotically, and which only applies to nested models in any case.”</li>

<li>Therefore, under se_diff, we see 4.9 is our comparison value to focus on.</li>

<li>Outliers
<ul>
<li>Detection
<ul>
<li>High p_waic (WAIC) and k (PSIS) values can indicate outliers
<ul>
<li>Rare values have greater influence on the posterior. (somehow this translates into a larger p_waic)
<ul>
<li>The posterior changes a lot when they are dropped from the sample</li>
</ul></li>
<li>k values &gt; 0.5 will trigger a warning, but not until values exceed 0.7 do they indicate an outlier (See PSIS for details)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Solutions
<ul>
<li>If there are only a few outliers, and you are sure to report results both with and without them, dropping outliers might be okay.</li>
<li>If there are several outliers, then a form of <em>Robust Regression</em> can be used or a <em>Mixture Model</em>.
<ul>
<li>Common to use a Student’s T distribution instead of a Gaussian for the outcome variable specification
<ul>
<li>The Student-t distribution arises from a mixture of Gaussian distributions with different variances. If the variances are diverse, then the tails can be quite thick.</li>
<li>Has an extra shape parameter, ν, that controls how thick the tails are.
<ul>
<li>ν = ∞ is a Gaussian distribution</li>
<li>As v –&gt; 1+ , tails start becoming fat</li>
<li>ν can be estimated with very large datasets that have plenty of rare events</li>

<li><p>Model without interaction (top row): shows that water (predictor) helps—there is a positive slope in each plot—and that shade hurts—the lines sink lower moving from left to right. But the slope with water doesn’t vary across shade levels. Without the interaction, it cannot vary.</p></li>
<li><p>Model with interaction (bottom row): The slope is allowed to vary. At higher light levels, water can matter more, because the tulips have enough light to produce blooms. At very high light levels, light is no longer limiting the blooms, and so water can have a much more dramatic impact on the outcome.</p></li>

<ul>
<li>The search for a sampling algorithm that can produce a good description of the posterior in the fewest amount of samples of the joint posterior distribution.</li>
<li>Quadratic approximation, <code>quap( )</code>, assumes the posterior is a multivariate gaussian. These algorithms allow us to drop that assumption.</li>
<li>Gibbs sampling is more efficient than the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.
<ul>
<li>It computes something called adaptive proposals_,_ which allows it to make smart jumps around the joint posterior distribution of all parameters. This results in a good image of the posterior but in fewer steps than the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.
<ul>
<li><strong>adaptive proposals</strong> depend upon using particular combinations of prior distributions and likelihoods known as conjugate pairs.
<ul>
<li>Proposals are potential new parameter combinations in the posterior for the algorithm to jump to next.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Conjugate pairs</strong> are prior distributions that have the same posterior distribution.
<ul>
<li>They have analytical solutions which makes them faster.</li>
<li>Some conjugate priors are actually pathological in shape, once you start building multilevel models and need priors for entire covariance matrices this becomes a problem.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Very inefficient for complex models with hundreds or thousands of parameters
<ul>
<li>They gets stuck in small regions of the posterior because complex models have high correlation regions.
<ul>
<li>See Chapter 6, multicollinearity. When parameters value combinations contain roughly the same information, they become equally likely. This creates confusion for Gibbs and it gets stuck in these areas for longer periods of time.</li>
<li>Handles U-turn problem (see below) by using a burn-in phase. Unlike HMC’s warm-up phase, burn-in uses actual samples from the joint posterior density.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (or Hybrid Monte Carlo, HMC)
<ul>
<li>Requires more computation time for each sample of the joint posterior but needs fewer samples.</li>
<li>King Monty’s Royal Drive (Parable that describes how HMC samples the joint posterior) <img src="./_resources/Untitled_Note.resources/Screenshot (184).png" class="img-fluid">
<ul>
<li>The kingdom is valley that runs North and South. King must visit towns but the amount of visits must be in proportion to the towns population. Towns at higher elevations have lower population that towns at lower elevation. Y axis is elevation I think and +/- is North/South. A point is a town where the king visits.</li>
<li>The journey begins at time 1 on the far left. The vehicle is given a random momentum and a random direction, either north (top) or south (bottom). The thickness of the path shows momentum at each moment. The vehicle travels, losing momentum uphill or gaining it downhill. After a fixed amount of time, they stop and make a visit, as shown by the points (aka samples). Then a new random direction and momentum is chosen. In the long run, positions are visited in proportion to their population density
<ul>
<li>The valley bottom at zero represents the region of the joint posterior where the parameter combinations have the highest likelihoods. Each new parameter value combination (point in chart) is the result of a random direction (north or south) and random momentum being chosen.</li>
<li>Think the thickness of the regions represent the amount of probability density. Also, it requires larger and larger amounts of “momentum” to reach the regions of lower probability density.</li>
<li>This chart (aka trace plot) represents one chain with 19 samples (points) from the joint posterior</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hamiltonian differential equations are what drives this algorithm. Actually runs a physics simulation. The king’s car is a frictionless particle moving along a gradient surface. The combination of parameter values is the particle’s multi-dimensional position.</li>
<li>Requires continuous parameters</li>
<li>Steps (see pg 282 for the gradient math and endnote 143 for moar math detail)
<ol type="1">
<li>Calculate the negative log-probability of every combination of parameter values. (aka elevation of towns, top part of Bayes equation)</li>
<li>Calculate the gradient at the current position. This is the solution to the partial derivative of the equation that computes the negative log-probability for a given position.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Hyperparameters (usually chosen for you)
<ul>
<li><strong>Leapfrog Steps</strong> (L)
<ul>
<li>Each path between parameter combinations (towns) is made up of leapfrog steps. This value is the number of leapfrog steps in each path. The larger this value, the longer the paths.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Step Size</strong> (ε)
<ul>
<li>The size of each leapfrog step</li>
<li>Determines granularity of the simulation. Small step sizes means the particles (king’s car) in the simulation can turn sharply. Large step sizes means desirable points can be overshot.</li>
<li><code>adapt_delta</code> parameter
<ul>
<li>the target average proposal acceptance probability in the adaptation, which is used to determine the step size during warmup</li>
<li>A higher desired acceptance probability (closer to 1) reduces the the step size.</li>
<li>A smaller step size means that it will require more steps to explore the posterior distribution.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Tree-depth</strong>
<ul>
<li>Number of leapfrog steps to take in each iteration</li>
<li>A too-small maximum tree-depth only affects efficiency
<ul>
<li>Exploration will be slower and the autocorrelation higher (effective sample size lower) than if the maximum tree-depth were set higher</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqz5AJjyugM">Lecture 8</a> has a really nice animation of the HMC sampling process with leapfrog steps, stepsize, etc.<img src="./_resources/Untitled_Note.resources/Screenshot (815).png" class="img-fluid">
<ul>
<li>Left: Gaussian posterior; Right: posterior from 2 parameters of a hierarchical model</li>
<li>Blue segments are the leapfrog steps
<ul>
<li>There can be many steps between sampled values</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The length of each blue segment is the step size</li>
<li>Black circles are the sampled parameter values</li>
</ul></li>
<li>U-turn problem
<ul>
<li>When L and ε are too large, parameter value combinations can be sampled close to each other. This leads to correlated samples which is bad (see Gibbs sampling above and Chapter 6 multicollinearity).
<ul>
<li>Leads to having paths where that lead up the gradient, u-turns, and back down the gradient to the same region of the posterior where the path started.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Solution
<ul>
<li><strong>warm-up</strong> - rstan conducts a warm-up phase to determine appropriate an L and ε
<ul>
<li>This simulation tuning usually takes longer than the actual HMC sampling</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>NUTS</strong> (No U-turn Samplers): It guesses the shape of the posterior. Using this guess, it can determine when the path is turning back towards the previous region and then adapts the L value.
<ul>
<li>Stan uses NUTS2</li>

<li>Sampling Diagnostics
<ul>
<li>Vehtari, Gelman (2019) paper on this ESS and Rhat, https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08008?</li>
<li>** HMC is easier to diagnose bad chains than Metropolis or Gibbs.
<ul>
<li>Gibbs doesn’t use gradients, so it doesn’t notice some issues that a Hamiltonian engine will
<ul>
<li>With Gibbs you won’t get informative warnings when sampling goes bad</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Effective Sample Size</strong> (ESS)
<ul>
<li>Measures the amount by which autocorrelation in samples increases uncertainty (standard errors) relative to an independent sample.
<ul>
<li>Markov chains are typically autocorrelated, so that sequential samples are not entirely independent.</li>
<li>More autocorrelation means fewer effective number of samples.</li>
<li>Autocorrelated samples provide similar information, so a chain with autocorrelation is less efficient</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>larger is better</strong> (for all ESS metrics)</li>
<li><strong>n_eff</strong> in <span style="color: #990000">{rethinking}</span> <code>precis</code> output
<ul>
<li>Tells you how many samples the chain would have if there was 0 autocorrelation between samples in the chain</li>
<li>Almost always smaller than the number of samples specified in the model function</li>
</ul></li>
<li>brms returns Bulk_ESS and Tail_ESS in the model output summary
<ul>
<li>Chains don’t uniformly converge across the parameter space</li>
<li><strong>Bulk_ESS</strong> - effective sample size around the bulk of the posterior (i.e.&nbsp;around the mean or median) (same as McElreath’s n_eff)
<ul>
<li>“assesses how well the centre of the distribution is resolved”
<ul>
<li>i.e.&nbsp;measures how well HMC sampled the posterior around the bulk of the distribution in order to determine its shape.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When value is much lower than the actual number of iterations (minus warmup) of your chains, it means the chains are inefficient, but possibly still okay
<ul>
<li>In the <span class="ribbon-highlight">Example</span>, 2000 total samples with 1000 of those used for warm-up which is brms default. 4 chains x 1000 samples = 4000 post-warm-up samples. So for each parameter, the ESS should be around that or above</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Tail_ESS</strong> - effective sample size in the tails of the posterior
<ul>
<li>i.e.&nbsp;measures how well HMC sampled the posterior in the tails of the distribution in order to determine their shape.</li>
<li>estimates the Monte Carlo Standard Error (MCSE) for samples in posterior tails</li>
<li>No idea what’s good here.</li>
<li>If you get warnings, taking more samples usually helps</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Rhat</strong> - Gelman-Rubin convergence diagnostic
<ul>
<li>estimate of the convergence of Markov chains to the target distribution
<ul>
<li>Checks if the start and end of each chain explores the same region</li>
<li>Checks that independent chains explore the same region</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ratio of variances
<ul>
<li>As total variance among all chains shrinks to the average variance within chains, R-hat approaches 1</li>
<li>If converges, Rhat = 1+</li>
<li>If value is above 1.00, it usually indicates that the chain has not yet converged, and probably you shouldn’t trust the samples.
<ul>
<li>If you draw more iterations, it could be fine, or it could never converge.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>This diagnostic can fail for more complex models (i.e.&nbsp;bad chains even when value = 1)
<ul>
<li>They seem to be improving this diagnostic though. As of 2021, think there’s a version 5, Rhat5.</li>

<li>The number of chains allows you to reduce the variance of your Monte Carlo estimator, which is what the sampling phase is for, but not the bias, which is what the warmup phase is for.</li>
<li>warm-up samples
<ul>
<li>you want to have the shortest warmup period necessary, so you can get on with real sampling. But on the other hand, more warmup can mean more efficient sampling.</li>
<li>But if you are having trouble, you might try increasing the warmup. If not, you might try reducing it.</li>
<li>more complicated the model, the more warm-up samples you need.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>post-warmup samples
<ul>
<li>If all you want are posterior means, it doesn’t take many samples at all to get very good estimates. Even a couple hundred samples will do</li>
<li>if you care about the exact shape in the extreme tails of the posterior, the 99th percentile or so, then you’ll need many more</li>
<li>In most typical regression applications, you can get a very good estimate of the posterior mean with as few as 200 effective samples. And if the posterior is approximately Gaussian, then all you need in addition is a good estimate of the variance, which can be had with one order of magnitude more, in most cases.</li>
<li>For highly skewed posteriors, you’ll have to think more about which region of the distribution interests you. Stan will sometimes warn you about “tail ESS,” which means the effective sample size in the tails of the posterior. In those cases, it is nervous about the quality of extreme intervals, like 95%. Sampling more usually helps.</li>

<li>Chains

<li>Chain validation

<li>Make sure sure autocorrelation within the sampling isn’t an issue. (i.e.&nbsp;lazy caterpillars, etc.)</li>
<li>When you run multiple Markov chains, each with different starting positions, and see that all of them end up in the same region of parameter space, it provides a check that the sampling is working correctly (Also see Starting Values in Ch 4)</li>

<ul>
<li>The principle of maximum entropy provides an empirically successful way to choose likelihood functions. Information entropy is essentially a measure of the number of ways a distribution can arise, according to stated assumptions. By choosing the distribution with the biggest information entropy, we thereby choose a distribution that obeys the constraints on outcome variables, without importing additional assumptions. Generalized linear models arise naturally from this approach, as extensions of the linear models in previous chapters.</li>
<li>The <strong>maximum entropy distribution</strong> is the one with the greatest information entropy (i.e.&nbsp;log number of ways per event) and is the most plausible distribution.
<ul>
<li>No guarantee that this is the best probability distribution for the real problem you are analyzing. But there is a guarantee that no other distribution more conservatively reflects your assumptions.</li>
<li>maximum entropy also provides a way to generate a more informative prior that embodies the background information, while assuming as little else as possible.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bayesian inference can be seen as producing a posterior distribution that is most similar to the prior distribution as possible, while remaining logically consistent with the stated information (i.e.&nbsp;the data).</li>
<li><strong>Gaussian</strong>
<ul>
<li>A perfectly uniform distribution would have infinite variance, in fact. So the variance constraint is actually a severe constraint, forcing the high-probability portion of the distribution to a small area around the mean.</li>
<li>The Gaussian distribution gets its shape by being as spread out as possible for a distribution with fixed variance.</li>
<li>The Gaussian distribution is the most conservative distribution for a continuous outcome variable with finite variance.
<ul>
<li>The mean µ doesn’t matter here, because entropy doesn’t depend upon location, just shape.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Binomial</strong>
<ul>
<li>Binomial distribution has the largest entropy of any distribution that satisfies these constraints:
<ul>
<li>only two unordered events (i.e.&nbsp;dichotomous)</li>
<li>constant expected value (i.e.&nbsp;exp_val = sum(prob*num_events))</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If only two un-ordered outcomes are possible and you think the process generating them is invariant in time—so that the expected value remains constant at each combination of predictor values— then the distribution that is most conservative is the binomial.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Exponential</strong>
<ul>
<li>constrained to be zero or positive</li>
<li>fundamental distribution of distance and duration, kinds of measurements that represent displacement from some point of reference, either in time or space.</li>
<li>If the probability of an event is constant in time or across space, then the distribution of events tends towards exponential.</li>
<li>Its shape is described by a single parameter, the rate of events λ, or the average displacement λ −1 .</li>
<li>This distribution is the core of survival and event history analysis</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Gamma</strong>
<ul>
<li>constrained to be zero or positive</li>
<li>like Exponential but can have a peak above zero</li>
<li>If an event can only happen after two or more exponentially distributed events happen, the resulting waiting times will be gamma distributed.
<ul>
<li>e.g.&nbsp;age of cancer onset is approximately gamma distributed, since multiple events are necessary for onset.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>shape parameter k and a scale parameter θ</li>
<li>Also used in survival</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Poisson</strong>
<ul>
<li>Count distribution like binomial</li>
<li>If the number of trials n is very large (and usually unknown) and the probability of a success p is very small, then a binomial distribution converges to a Poisson distribution with an expected rate of events per unit time of λ = np.</li>
<li>used for counts that never get close to any theoretical maximum</li>
<li>single parameter, the rate of events λ</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Link functions
<ul>
<li>Generalized linear models need a link function, because rarely is there a “µ”, a parameter describing the average outcome, and rarely are parameters unbounded in both directions, like µ is.</li>
<li><strong>logit link</strong>
<ul>
<li>maps a parameter that is defined as a probability mass, and therefore constrained to lie between zero and one, onto a linear model that can take on any real value.</li>
<li>yi ∼ Binomial(n, pi) logit(pi) = α + βxi
<ul>
<li>logit(pi) = log (pi / (1 − pi))
<ul>
<li>The logit is the log-odds of an event, and the “odds” of an event are just the probability it happens divided by the probability it does not happen</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>This transformation compresses the geometry far from zero (sigmoid shape), such that a unit change on the linear scale means less and less change on the probability scale</li>
<li>Inverse logit (logistic) pi = exp(α + βxi) / (1 + exp(α + βxi))</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>log link</strong>
<ul>
<li>maps a parameter that is defined over only positive real values onto a linear model
<ul>
<li>Negative values get mapped to [0,1] and positive values get mapped to &gt; 1.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>An increase of one unit on the log scale means an increase of an order of magnitude on the untransformed scale.</li>
<li>the log link effectively assumes is that the parameter’s value is the exponentiation of the linear model.</li>
<li>yi ∼ Normal(µ, σi) log(σi) = α + βxi
<ul>
<li>inverse: σi = exp(α + βxi)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>solves the problem of constraining the parameter to be positive, it may also create a problem when the model is asked to predict well outside the range of data used to fit it.
<ul>
<li>Eventually there’s a ceiling or change from the exponential behavior.
<ul>
<li>e.g.&nbsp;the property damage caused by a hurricane may be approximately exponentially related to wind speed for smaller storms. But for very big storms, damage may be capped by the fact that everything gets destroyed.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Aside (Histomancy): at most what a Gaussian likelihood assumes is not that the aggregated data look Gaussian, but rather that the residuals, after fitting the model, look Gaussian. So for <span class="ribbon-highlight">Example</span> the combined histogram of male and female body weights is certainly not Gaussian. But it is (approximately) a mixture of Gaussian distributions. So after conditioning on sex, the residuals may be quite normal. Other times, people decide not to use a Poisson model, because the variance of the aggregate outcome exceeds its mean (see Chapter 11). But again, at most what a Poisson likelihood assumes is that the variance equals the mean after conditioning on predictors.</li>
<li>Omitted Variable Bias
<ul>
<li>can be worse in GLMs, because even a variable that isn’t technically a confounder can bias inference, once we have a link function. The reason is that the ceiling and floor effects can distort estimates by suppressing the causal influence of a variable
<ul>
<li>e.g.&nbsp;A unit change in a predictor variable no longer produces a constant change in the mean of the outcome variable. Instead, a unit change in xi may produce a larger or smaller change in the probability pi , depending upon how far from zero the log-odds are.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Suppose for <span class="ribbon-highlight">Example</span> that two variables X and Z independently influence a binary outcome Y. If either X and Z is large enough, then Y = 1. Both variables are sufficient causes of Y. Now if we don’t measure Z but only X, we might consistently underestimate the causal effect of X. Why? Because Z is sufficient for Y to equal 1, and we didn’t measure Z. So there are cases in the data where X is small but Y = 1. These cases imply X does not influence Y very strongly, but only because we are ignoring Z. This phenomenon doesn’t occur in ordinary linear regression, because independent causes just contribute to the mean. There are no ceiling or floor effects (in theory).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When using link functions, each parameter represents a relatAive difference on the scale of the linear model, ignoring other parameters, while we are really interested in absolute differences in outcomes that must incorporate all parameters</li>
<li>Can’t use any information criteria prediction metrics to compare models with different likelihood functions</li>

<li>Experiment: A chimp is at a long table with a lever on the left side and the right side of table. When a lever is pulled, the chimp gets a plate of food.

<li><p>db13 is the difference between no-partner/partner treatments when the prosocial option was on the right.</p>
<ul>
<li>So if there is evidence of more prosocial choice when partner is present, this will show up here as a larger difference, consistent with pulling right more when partner is present.</li>
<li>Weak evidence that individuals pulled left more when the partner was absent, but the compatibility interval is quite wide.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>db24 is the same difference, but for when the prosocial option was on the left.</p>
<ul>
<li>Now negative differences would be consistent with more prosocial choice when partner is present.</li>
<li>Clearly that is not the case. If anything, individuals chose prosocial more when partner was absent.</li>

<ul>
<li>Observed Proportions is the proportion of left pulls for each chimp for each treatment in the sample data</li>
<li>Posterior Predictions gets predictions from the model from a dataset with distinct combos of actor, treatment, prosoc_left from the sample data.</li>
<li>We don’t want an exact match—that would mean overfitting. But if the posterior predictions generally follow the same pattern as the observed proportions, then it’s a reasonable fit and we didn’t misspecify something.
<ul>
<li>Also, we would like to understand how the model sees the data and learn from any anomalies.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Interpretation
<ul>
<li>The observed proportions themselves show additional variation—some of the actors possibly respond more to the treatments than others do. (Some line slopes steep)</li>
<li>The model (posterior predictions) expects almost no change when adding a partner.&nbsp; (lines nearly horizontal)
<ul>
<li>Point estimates for actors 1 and 7 don’t have the same trends as the observed data</li>

<li>Conclusion
<ul>
<li>Most of the variation in predictions comes from the actor intercepts. Handedness seems to be the big story of this experiment. (see Actor Effects)</li>
<li>With this much difference between the data and the model, we might consider a model that allows each unique actor to have unique treatment parameters (i.e.&nbsp;multi-level model).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Absolute Effects</strong>: The effect of a (counter-factual) change in predictor value (type of treatment) has on the outcome (<em>probability</em> of an event)
<ul>
<li>Rate that the event happens in the world (i.e.&nbsp;change in outcome event probability)</li>
<li>Base rate matters
<ul>
<li><span class="ribbon-highlight"><span class="ribbon-highlight">Example</span></span> (fictional)
<ul>
<li>1/1000 women develop blood clots (base rate), and an experiment shows that taking a pill raises the risk by 200% (relative risk)!! But that’s actually only 3/1000 now. So the absolute risk was only raised by 0.002.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Relative Effects</strong>: The effect of a (counter-factual) change in predictor value (type of treatment) has on the outcome (<em>odds</em> of an event)
<ul>
<li>Contrast differences on the log-odds scale (raw output) while holding all other predictors constant</li>
<li>Relative effects can be big while absolute effects are actually small
<ul>
<li>i.e.&nbsp;unimportant things can seem super important on the relative scale</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Needed to make causal inferences</li>
<li>Relative measures measures like proportional odds is they ignore what you might think of as the reference or the baseline.</li>
<li>Can be conditionally very important, when baseline rates of predictor variables change.
<ul>
<li><span class="ribbon-highlight"><span class="ribbon-highlight">Example</span></span>: Conditional on being in the ocean, sharks are much more dangerous than bees. So in this situation the relative risk is more important than the absolute risk.
<ul>
<li>The absolute risk says that bees are more dangerous to humans since the base rate for death by bee is larger because humans spend much more time on land with bees than in the ocean with sharks.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>On the absolute scale, males are now 2% less likely to be admitted than females but CIs do overlap zero.</li>
<li>Conditioning on Department matters because the rates of admission vary a lot across departments. Furthermore, women and men applied to different departments.</li>

<li>This is the expected posterior distribution of changing the (perceived) gender from female to male
<ul>
<li>The left figure, is his distribution from the lecture. He used his simulated model with only 2 departments and then used counterfactual data of all 6 depts to get predictions and contrasts. In terms of answering the question, I don’t think his model applies since it’s not representative of the data.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Interpretation
<ul>
<li>The median of the bi-modal distribution is close to 0, so there isn’t a credible average direct effect detected. Yet, visually it seems like the female advantaged side does contain a majority of the mass.
<ul>
<li>The average direct effect is calculated by <em>marginalizing</em> across departments</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The fact that it’s bimodal is due to the heterogeneity of the data. (i.e.&nbsp;the different acceptance and application rates of each department)</li>

<li>UCB Admissions Conclusion
<ul>
<li>** See
<ul>
<li><a href="Center for health equity">Center for health equity</a> for descriptions of <strong>direct</strong> and <strong>indirect</strong> discrimination</li>
<li>2022 Lecture 9 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPi5yGbfxuo">video</a>
<ul>
<li>He also describes how a proper analysis of this phenomenon would be conducted which includes sampling the applicant pool and ranking candidates to collect data in order to deal potential confounders to admission and department (e.g.&nbsp;latent variables like talent and ability)
<ul>
<li>This is also mentioned in the Specification section of this <span class="ribbon-highlight">Example</span></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>There is no direct discrimation detected (effect with conditioning on department, A ~ G + D).
<ul>
<li>On average, there is no discrimination detected by application reviewers within departments.</li>
<li>If this effect was detected, it would be the worst one if you’re the college. It would indicate people in the college are actively discriminating during the application process.</li>
<li>In the lecture video when generating fake data, he shows that different departmental acceptance rates for each gender can result in this type of discrimination effect</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There might be indirect discrimination (aka structural discrimination)&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>If this effect is detected, it might be the worst one if you’re a woman since the cause is likely something that can’t be easily fixed (e.g.&nbsp;by firing someone).</li>
<li>To figure this out you have to calculate the Average Causal Mediation Effect (ACME)
<ul>
<li>See <a href="Causal Inference">Causal Inference</a> &gt;&gt; Mediation Analysis for <span class="ribbon-highlight">Example</span>s and formulas.</li>
<li>Remember that this is NOT Admissions ~ Gender. This would the total effect which is both paths.</li>
<li>In Lecture 9 video, he uses an interaction. So if you model it that way, it complicates the ACME formula some.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Since we measured a significant total effect (A ~ G) but no direct effect (A ~ G + D), it seems reasonable that there could be indirect discrimination.
<ul>
<li>i.e.&nbsp;discrimination that leads 1 gender category or another not to apply to a particular department</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If there is structural discrimination, the reasons could be:&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>Females and males may apply disproportionately to different departments
<ul>
<li>From the data, we see that females apply to particular departments much more than others and more to departments with higher base rejection rates. Therefore, they got turned down more.
<ul>
<li>If females applied more evenly across departments, the discrimination effect should disappear.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Maybe something societal that makes females less comfortable in certain subjects. For <span class="ribbon-highlight">Example</span>, girls being told that girls aren’t as good at math as boys so they end up applying to less technical departments more.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Variation among departmental base rates of acceptance
<ul>
<li>Some departments may receive more funding which leads to accepting more students and a higher acceptance rate.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>He shows in Lecture 9 2022 video how variation in both of these aspects (at the same time) result in this type of discrimination effect.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>Reason being that it has extreme population size and the most tools</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Interpretation</p>
<ul>
<li>The trend for societies with high contact (solid) is higher than the trend for societies with low contact (dashed) when population size is low</li>
<li>The means cross one another at high population sizes.
<ul>
<li>model is actually saying it has no idea where the trend for high contact societies goes at high population sizes, because there are no high population size societies with high contact. There is only low-contact Hawaii. But it is still a silly pattern that we know shouldn’t happen. A counter-factual Hawaii with the same population size but high contact should theoretically have at least as many tools as the real Hawaii. It shouldn’t have fewer</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Low contact fitted values have a y-intercept at around 20 which is impossible since you can’t have 0 population (x-axis) and have tools
<ul>
<li>The fitted line should go through (0,0)</li>

<ul>
<li>Thoughts about the components in Bayes theorem (from Chapter 4)
<ul>
<li>The likelihood, prior, and posterior densities are probability densities each with an area = 1. Looking at the marble tables it looks like the individual posterior probabilities sum to 1. So, the sum (we’re talking densities so probably this “sum” = integration actually) of all the products of the multiiplication of the prior and likelihood densities must not have an area = 1. Therefore, the denominator (i.e.&nbsp;sum of products) then standardizes these products so the posterior density does have an area of 1.</li>
<li>Would this make the posterior a joint density of parameter combinations (aka conjectures)?&nbsp; It does (pg 96)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Getting a handle on characteristics of masking and multicollinearity
<ul>
<li>The <span class="ribbon-highlight">Example</span>s seem quite similar because of the correlation structures between the variables. This is just me brainstorming. tldr in Take away section</li>
<li>Masking is in Ch. 5 and Multicollinearity in Ch. 6</li>
<li>Masking <span class="ribbon-highlight">Example</span>
<ul>
<li>correlations
<ul>
<li>pred_var1 and pred_var1 are (strongly) positively correlated</li>
<li>pred_var1 is (mildly) <em>negatively</em> correlated with the outcome</li>
<li>pred_var2 is (mildly) <em>positively</em> correlated with the outcome</li>
</ul></li>
<li>multivariate vs bivariate effects
<ul>
<li>the magnitude of each predictor’s effect is increased</li>
<li>sd increased slightly but the sd/effect ratio decreases since the effect increased</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Multicollinearity <span class="ribbon-highlight">Example</span>
<ul>
<li>correlations
<ul>
<li>same but predictors are (strongly) negatively correlated with each other and (strongly) correlated with the outcome</li>

<li>multivariate covers effect.</li>
<li>predictions are fine

<li>but PIs inflated?</li>

</ul></li>
<li>strength of correlation of predictors with outcome was mild then strong</li>

</ul></li>
<li>issues
<ul>
<li>multicollinearity:
<ul>
<li>standard errors are large which affects inference</li>
<li>effect shrinkage could cause sign flips</li>
<li>PIs inflated?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>masking:
<ul>
<li>Maybe this becomes a source of confusion if doing robustness checks?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>“solution”
<ul>
<li>multicollinearity:
<ul>
<li>domain knowledge — is there a 3rd variable that influences both of the collinear variables
<ul>
<li>not supposed to automatically drop a variable</li>
<li>regression with outcome and this third variable and drop the mediators</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>masking:
<ul>
<li>Both variables need to be included in the regression</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Take away
<ul>
<li>Inference
<ul>
<li>masking
<ul>
<li>unless there’s some sort of variable reduction necessary and there’s a masking relationship with the variable of interest and another variable and the “other” one gets removed, I don’t think this is an issue</li>
<li>Maybe this becomes a source of confusion if doing robustness checks</li>
</ul></li>
<li>multicollinearity
<ul>
<li>inference impossible
<ul>
<li>std devs will blow-up</li>
<li>point estimate signs may flip as compared to a bivariate regression</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Prediction
<ul>
<li>masking
<ul>
<li>Shouldn’t matter with model selection. If a group of masked variables is important to prediction, they should all get selected.
<ul>
<li>Maybe possible some combination of masked variables and other variables has an opposite effect and one of the masked variables gets dropped. But then the masked group wasn’t terribly important to begin with.&nbsp; Could explain variations in Variable Importance with different models. Prediction is all and not variable importance though so still not a big issue.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>multicollinearity
<ul>
<li>PIs may be inflated</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Other
<ul>
<li>masking: I think it’s just a phenomenon that’s rarely an issue</li>
<li>multicollinearity: important in both but will be evident in inference; not so much in prediction</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Questions
<ul>
<li>if the sign of the collinearity were positive in the multicollinearity <span class="ribbon-highlight">Example</span>, would the effects increase?</li>
<li>As the strength of the collinearity increases, does sd gradually increase or is there some kind of threshold? (r &gt; .90)</li>
<li>Is there a sort of linear path from masking to full multicollinearity?
<ul>
<li>would need to figure out if correlation signs matter, pred vs pred and pred vs outcome</li>
<li>combinations of strong and week corr by one and both preds</li>
<li>gradation from weak to strong</li>
<li>project with animation?</li>

<li>The Haunted DAG
<ul>
<li>section 6.3.2</li>
<li>Most texts use only 3 variables when introducing Simpson’s Paradox but McElreath uses 4 here
<ul>
<li>Simpson’s Paradox is a statistical phenomenon where adding conditioning variables changes the effect and interpretation of the variable of interest. The variables that are causing the change are adding backdoor paths. So, the scientific question and its DAG determine causality. An <span class="ribbon-highlight">Example</span> of why you just can’t keep adding control variables.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Variables
<ul>
<li>C is the outcome variable, Child’s education level</li>
<li>G is grandparent’s education level</li>
<li>P is parent’s education level</li>
<li>U is the neighborhood quality with values: good or bad</li>
</ul></li>
<li><img src="./_resources/Untitled_Note.resources/Screenshot (123).png" class="img-fluid"></li>
<li>Initial thoughts on the dag
<ul>
<li>PUC: a fork, so it’s path is open unless U is conditioned upon, U is the confounder</li>
<li>GPC: a pipe, conditioning on P would block the path from G through P to C and leave only G to C. P is the confounder here.</li>
<li>GPUC: Adjusting for P closes P to C; adjusting for U opens P to C
<ul>
<li>P is a collider</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Sim data (think magnitudes)
<ul>
<li>G to C is given effect = 0</li>
<li>G to P is given effect = 1</li>
<li>P to C is given effect = 1</li>
<li>U to C and P is given effect = 2</li>
</ul></li>
<li>His first regression C ~ a + G + P
<ul>
<li>G estimate ~ (-1) and P estimate ~ 2</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>The reason is unobserved effect of U on P and C creates illusion that G’s influence on C is negative (when it’s actually 0).</li>

<li>filled dots are parent with education levels within the 45 and 65 percentile. The rest of the info is annotated in the plot</li>
<li>2 parents with average education but one having a G with below 0 education and the other having above 0 education will necessarily live in different neighborhoods
<ul>
<li>if you split the plot into G’s below 0 and above 0, then for the most part, blue filled dots are on the left and black filled dots on the right.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Regressing a line through this subpopulation of parents gives the negative estimated effect between G and C.</li>
<li>i.e.&nbsp;we held parents education at it’s average (standardized var) and the relationship between G and C is negative (i.e.&nbsp;1st regression). By coloring this subpopulation by U, we see WHY it’s negative and the effect of U on P by the distinct groups of parents into different neighborhoods.</li>

<li>Takeaway
<ul>
<li>1st reg - Not conditioning on U
<ul>
<li>blocked the true effect between P and C</li>
<li>Without conditioning on U but conditioning on the collider P:
<ul>
<li>all U’s influence on C was channeled through P which inflated P’s estimated effect</li>
<li>P produced a spurious association between G and C which is seen in G’s estimated negative effect</li>
</ul></li>
<li><img src="./_resources/Untitled_Note.resources/Screenshot (129).png" class="img-fluid"></li>
</ul></li>
<li>2nd reg - conditioning on U
<ul>
<li>U’s association between P and C taken into account
<ul>
<li>i.e.&nbsp;the path between P and C is unblocked which equals true effect</li>
</ul></li>
<li>P is no longer a collider and conditioning on P blocks G’s influence on C THROUGH P which allows only G’s true effect on C to be estimated.<img src="./_resources/Untitled_Note.resources/Screenshot (130).png" class="img-fluid"></li>

<li>inits&nbsp;argument is for starting values in brms (Ch 4)
<ul>
<li>Either “random” or “0”. If inits is “random” (the default), Stan will randomly generate initial values for parameters.
<ul>
<li>If “0”,&nbsp; then all parameters are initialized to zero.</li>
<li>“random” randomly selects the starting points from a uniform distribution ranging from -2 to 2</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This option is sometimes useful for certain families, as it happens that default (“random”) inits cause samples to be essentially constant.</li>
<li>When everything goes well, the MCMC chains will all have traversed from their starting values to sampling probabilistically from the posterior distribution once they have emerged from the warmup phase. Sometimes the chains get stuck around their stating values and continue to linger there, even after you have terminated the warmup period. When this happens, you’ll end up with samples that are still tainted by their starting values and are not yet representative of the posterior distribution.
<ul>
<li>setting inits = “0” is worth a try, if chains do not behave well.</li>
<li>Alternatively, inits can be a list of lists containing the initial values, or a function (or function name) generating initial values. The latter options are mainly implemented for internal testing but are available to users if necessary. If specifying initial values using a list or a function then currently the parameter names must correspond to the names used in the generated Stan code (not the names used in R).</li>

<li>If all you want to do is fit the models, you wouldn’t have to add a separate&nbsp;prior()&nbsp;statement for each level of&nbsp;treatment. You could have just included a single line,&nbsp;prior(normal(0, 0.5), nlpar = b), that did not include a&nbsp;coef&nbsp;argument. The problem with this approach is we’d only get one column for&nbsp;treatment&nbsp;when using the&nbsp;prior_samples()&nbsp;function to retrieve the prior samples.
