-   A conjectured proportion of blue marbles, p, is usually called a [**parameter value**]{style="color: #14adff"}. It's just a way of indexing possible explanations of the data
    -   Here p, proportion of surface water (See example below), is the unknown parameter, but the conjecture could also be other things like sample size, treatment effect, group variation, etc.
    -   There can also be multiple unknown parameters for the likelihood to consider.
    -   Every parameter must have a corresponding prior probability assigned to it.
-   The relative number of ways that a value p can produce the data is usually called a [**likelihood**]{style="color: #14adff"}.
    -   It is derived by the enumerating all the possible data sequences that could have happened and then eliminating those sequences inconsistent with the data (i.e. paths_consistent_with_data / total_paths).
    -   As a model component, the likelihood is a function that gives the probability of an observation given a parameter value (conjecture)
        -   "how likely your sample data is out of all sample data of the same length?"
-   The prior plausibility of any specific p is usually called the [**prior probability**]{style="color: #14adff"}.
    -   A distribution initial plausibilities for every value of a parameter
    -   Expresses prior knowledge about a parameter and constrains estimates to reasonable ranges
    -   Unless there's already strong evidence for using a particular prior, multiple priors should be tried to see how sensitive the estimates are to the choice of a prior
    -   Example where the prior is a probability distribution for the parameter:
        -   p is distributed Uniformly between 0 and 1, (i.e. each conjecture is equally likely), $p \sim \mbox{Uniform}(0, 1)$
    -   [**Weakly Informative**]{style="color: #14adff"} or [**Regularizing priors**]{style="color: #14adff"}: conservative; guards against inferences of strong association
        -   mathematically equivalent to penalized likelihood
-   The new, updated relative plausibility of a specific *p* is called the [**posterior probability**]{style="color: #14adff"}.
-   The set of estimates, aka relative plausibilities of different parameter values, aka posterior probabilities, conditional on the data --- is known as the [**posterior distribution**]{style="color: #14adff"} or [**posterior density**]{style="color: #14adff"} (e.g. $Pr(p | N, W)$).
