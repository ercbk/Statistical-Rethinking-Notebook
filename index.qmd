# Preface {.unnumbered}

These are notes taken while reading [Statistical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) by Richard McElreath and watching his lectures. Most of the code is sourced or adapted from Solomon Kurz's [book](https://bookdown.org/content/4857/) which translates the [{]{style="color: #990000"}[rethinking](https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking){style="color: #990000"}[}]{style="color: #990000"} code used by McElreath to [{]{style="color: #990000"}[brms](https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/){style="color: #990000"}[}]{style="color: #990000"}.

These notes were transferred from Evernote to Quarto, so some of notes may be difficult to read as the editing of the note format is still an ongoing process.
